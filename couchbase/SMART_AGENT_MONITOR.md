### INSTALLATION

This integration is part of the [SignalFx Smart Agent](https://github.com/signalfx/integrations/tree/master/signalfx-agent)[](sfx_link:signalfx-agent)
as the `collectd/couchbase` monitor. You should first deploy the Smart Agent to the
same host as the service you want to monitor, and then continue with the
configuration instructions below.

# collectd/couchbase

Monitor Type: `collectd/couchbase` ([Source](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/internal/monitors/collectd/couchbase))

**Accepts Endpoints**: **Yes**

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: Yes


## Description

**This integration primarily consists of the Smart Agent monitor `collectd/couchbase`.
Below is an overview of that monitor.**

### Smart Agent Monitor


This is a Smart Agent monitor for [Couchbase](https://www.couchbase.com/)
that uses the [couchbase collectd Python
plugin](https://github.com/signalfx/collectd-couchbase) to collect metrics
from Couchbase server instances.

For general reference on how to monitor Couchbase, see <a target="_blank"
href="http://blog.couchbase.com/monitoring-couchbase-cluster">Couchbase
Monitoring</a> and <a target="_blank"
href="http://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/4.0/monitoring/monitoring-rest.html">Monitor
using the REST API</a>.

<!--- METRICS --->
## Note on bucket metrics

This plugin emits some metrics about the bucket's performance across the
cluster, and some metrics about the bucket's performance per node.

Metrics beginning with `gauge.bucket.basic.*` and
`gauge.bucket.quota.*` are reported once per cluster. All other
bucket metrics (`gauge.bucket.*`) are reported by every node that hosts
that bucket. In order to analyze bucket performance for the entire bucket,
apply functions like Sum or Mean to group node-level metrics together by
bucket.

<!--- SETUP --->
## Example Config

Sample YAML configuration with custom query:

```yaml
monitors:
- type: collectd/couchbase
  host: 127.0.0.1
  port: 8091
  collectTarget: "NODE"
  clusterName: "my-cluster"
  username: "user"
  password: "password"
```


## Configuration

To activate this monitor in the Smart Agent, add the following to your
agent config:

```
monitors:  # All monitor config goes under this key
 - type: collectd/couchbase
   ...  # Additional config
```

**For a list of monitor options that are common to all monitors, see [Common
Configuration](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/docs/monitors/../monitor-config.md#common-configuration).**


| Config option | Required | Type | Description |

### Non-default metrics (version 4.7.0+)

**The following information applies to the agent version 4.7.0+ that has
`enableBuiltInFiltering: true` set on the top level of the agent config.**

To emit metrics that are not _default_, you can add those metrics in the
generic monitor-level `extraMetrics` config option.  Metrics that are derived
from specific configuration options that do not appear in the above list of
metrics do not need to be added to `extraMetrics`.

To see a list of metrics that will be emitted you can run `agent-status
monitors` after configuring this monitor in a running agent instance.

### Legacy non-default metrics (version < 4.7.0)

**The following information only applies to agent version older than 4.7.0. If
you have a newer agent and have set `enableBuiltInFiltering: true` at the top
level of your agent config, see the section above. See upgrade instructions in
[Old-style whitelist filtering](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/docs/monitors/../legacy-filtering.md#old-style-whitelist-filtering).**

If you have a reference to the `whitelist.json` in your agent's top-level
`metricsToExclude` config option, and you want to emit metrics that are not in
that whitelist, then you need to add an item to the top-level
`metricsToInclude` config option to override that whitelist (see [Inclusion
filtering](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/docs/monitors/../legacy-filtering.md#inclusion-filtering).  Or you can just
copy the whitelist.json, modify it, and reference that in `metricsToExclude`.
