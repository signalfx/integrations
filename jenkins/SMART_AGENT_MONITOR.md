### INSTALLATION

This integration is part of the [SignalFx Smart Agent](https://github.com/signalfx/integrations/tree/master/signalfx-agent)[](sfx_link:signalfx-agent)
as the `collectd/jenkins` monitor. You should first deploy the Smart Agent to the
same host as the service you want to monitor, and then continue with the
configuration instructions below.

# collectd/jenkins

Monitor Type: `collectd/jenkins` ([Source](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/internal/monitors/collectd/jenkins))

**Accepts Endpoints**: **Yes**

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: Yes


## Description

**This integration primarily consists of the Smart Agent monitor `collectd/jenkins`.
Below is an overview of that monitor.**

### Smart Agent Monitor


Monitors jenkins by using the
[jenkins collectd Python
plugin](https://github.com/signalfx/collectd-jenkins), which collects
metrics from Jenkins instances by hitting these endpoints:
[../api/json](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/jenkins/remote+access+api)
(job metrics)  and
[metrics/&lt;MetricsKey&gt;/..](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Metrics+Plugin)
(default and optional Codahale/Dropwizard JVM metrics).

Requires Jenkins 1.580.3 or later, as well as the Jenkins Metrics Plugin (see Setup).

<!--- SETUP --->
## Install Jenkins Metrics Plugin
This monitor requires the Metrics Plugin in Jenkins. Go to `Manage Jenkins -> Manage Plugins -> Available -> Search "Metrics Plugin"`
to find and install this plugin in your Jenkins UI.

## Example Config

Sample YAML configuration:

```yaml
monitors:
- type: collectd/jenkins
  host: 127.0.0.1
  port: 8080
  metricsKey: reallylongmetricskey
```

Sample YAML configuration with specific enhanced metrics included

```yaml
monitors:
- type: collectd/jenkins
  host: 127.0.0.1
  port: 8080
  metricsKey: reallylongmetricskey
  includeMetrics:
  - "vm.daemon.count"
  - "vm.terminated.count"
```

Sample YAML configuration with all enhanced metrics included

```yaml
monitors:
- type: collectd/jenkins
  host: 127.0.0.1
  port: 8080
  metricsKey: reallylongmetricskey
  enhancedMetrics: true
```


## Configuration

To activate this monitor in the Smart Agent, add the following to your
agent config:

```
monitors:  # All monitor config goes under this key
 - type: collectd/jenkins
   ...  # Additional config
```

**For a list of monitor options that are common to all monitors, see [Common
Configuration](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/docs/monitors/../monitor-config.md#common-configuration).**


| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `pythonBinary` | no | `string` | Path to a python binary that should be used to execute the Python code. If not set, a built-in runtime will be used.  Can include arguments to the binary as well. |
| `host` | **yes** | `string` |  |
| `port` | **yes** | `integer` |  |
| `metricsKey` | **yes** | `string` | Key required for collecting metrics.  The access key located at `Manage Jenkins > Configure System > Metrics > ADD.` If empty, click `Generate`. |
| `enhancedMetrics` | no | `bool` | Whether to enable enhanced metrics (**default:** `false`) |
| `includeMetrics` | no | `list of strings` | Used to enable individual enhanced metrics when `enhancedMetrics` is false |
| `username` | no | `string` | User with security access to jenkins |
| `apiToken` | no | `string` | API Token of the user |
| `sslKeyFile` | no | `string` | Path to the keyfile |
| `sslCertificate` | no | `string` | Path to the certificate |
| `sslCACerts` | no | `string` | Path to the ca file |


## Metrics

These are the metrics available for this monitor.
Metrics that are categorized as
[container/host](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/admin-guide/usage.html#about-custom-bundled-and-high-resolution-metrics)
(*default*) are ***in bold and italics*** in the list below.


 - ***`gauge.jenkins.job.duration`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Time taken to complete the job in ms.
 - ***`gauge.jenkins.node.executor.count.value`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Total Number of executors in an instance
 - ***`gauge.jenkins.node.executor.in-use.value`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Total number of executors being used in an instance
 - ***`gauge.jenkins.node.health-check.score`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Mean health score of an instance
 - ***`gauge.jenkins.node.health.disk.space`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Binary value of disk space health
 - ***`gauge.jenkins.node.health.plugins`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Boolean value indicating state of plugins
 - ***`gauge.jenkins.node.health.temporary.space`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Binary value of temporary space health
 - ***`gauge.jenkins.node.health.thread-deadlock`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Boolean value indicating a deadlock
 - ***`gauge.jenkins.node.online.status`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Boolean value of instance is reachable or not
 - ***`gauge.jenkins.node.queue.size.value`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Total number pending jobs in queue
 - ***`gauge.jenkins.node.slave.online.status`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Boolean value for slave is reachable or not
 - ***`gauge.jenkins.node.vm.memory.heap.usage`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Percent utilization of the heap memory
 - ***`gauge.jenkins.node.vm.memory.non-heap.used`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Total amount of non-heap memory used
 - ***`gauge.jenkins.node.vm.memory.total.used`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Total Memory used by instance

### Non-default metrics (version 4.7.0+)

**The following information applies to the agent version 4.7.0+ that has
`enableBuiltInFiltering: true` set on the top level of the agent config.**

To emit metrics that are not _default_, you can add those metrics in the
generic monitor-level `extraMetrics` config option.  Metrics that are derived
from specific configuration options that do not appear in the above list of
metrics do not need to be added to `extraMetrics`.

To see a list of metrics that will be emitted you can run `agent-status
monitors` after configuring this monitor in a running agent instance.

### Legacy non-default metrics (version < 4.7.0)

**The following information only applies to agent version older than 4.7.0. If
you have a newer agent and have set `enableBuiltInFiltering: true` at the top
level of your agent config, see the section above. See upgrade instructions in
[Old-style whitelist filtering](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/docs/monitors/../legacy-filtering.md#old-style-whitelist-filtering).**

If you have a reference to the `whitelist.json` in your agent's top-level
`metricsToExclude` config option, and you want to emit metrics that are not in
that whitelist, then you need to add an item to the top-level
`metricsToInclude` config option to override that whitelist (see [Inclusion
filtering](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/docs/monitors/../legacy-filtering.md#inclusion-filtering).  Or you can just
copy the whitelist.json, modify it, and reference that in `metricsToExclude`.
