### DESCRIPTION

The OpenTelemetry Collector offers a vendor-agnostic implementation on how to receive, process and export telemetry data. In addition, it removes the need to run, operate and maintain multiple agents/collectors to support open-source telemetry data formats sending to multiple open-source or commercial back-ends.

### INSTALLATION

After installing the SignalFx Smart Agent on each instance, you can optionally send data from the SignalFx Smart Agent to the OpenTelemetry Collector. 

### USAGE

To deploy data collection for Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring:

1. Install and configure the SignalFx Smart Agent.
2. (Optional) Deploy the OpenTelemetry Collector.
