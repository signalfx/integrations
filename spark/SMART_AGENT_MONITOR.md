### INSTALLATION

This integration is part of the [SignalFx Smart Agent](https://github.com/signalfx/integrations/tree/master/signalfx-agent)[](sfx_link:signalfx-agent)
as the `collectd/spark` monitor. You should first deploy the Smart Agent to the
same host as the service you want to monitor, and then continue with the
configuration instructions below.

## Description

**This integration primarily consists of the Smart Agent monitor `collectd/spark`.
Below is an overview of that monitor.**

### Smart Agent Monitor


Collects metrics about a Spark cluster using the [collectd Spark Python
plugin](https://github.com/signalfx/collectd-spark). That plugin collects
metrics from Spark cluster and instances by hitting endpoints specified in
Spark's [Monitoring and Instrumentation
documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/monitoring.html) under
`REST API` and `Metrics`.

We currently only support cluster modes Standalone, Mesos, and Hadoop Yarn
via HTTP endpoints.

You have to specify distinct monitor configurations and discovery rules for
master and worker processes.  For the master configuration, set `isMaster`
to true.

When running Spark on Apache Hadoop / Yarn, this integration is only capable
of reporting application metrics from the master node.  Please use the
collectd/hadoop monitor to report on the health of the cluster.

<!--- SETUP --->
### Example config:

An example configuration for monitoring applications on Yarn
```yaml
monitors:
  - type: collectd/spark
    host: 000.000.000.000
    port: 8088
    clusterType: Yarn
    isMaster: true
    collectApplicationMetrics: true
```


## Configuration

To activate this monitor in the Smart Agent, add the following to your
agent config:

```
monitors:  # All monitor config goes under this key
 - type: collectd/spark
   ...  # Additional config
```

**For a list of monitor options that are common to all monitors, see [Common
Configuration](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/docs/monitors/../monitor-config.md#common-configuration).**


| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `pythonBinary` | no | `string` | Path to a python binary that should be used to execute the Python code. If not set, a built-in runtime will be used.  Can include arguments to the binary as well. |
| `host` | **yes** | `string` |  |
| `port` | **yes** | `integer` |  |
| `isMaster` | no | `bool` | Set to `true` when monitoring a master Spark node (**default:** `false`) |
| `clusterType` | **yes** | `string` | Should be one of `Standalone` or `Mesos` or `Yarn`.  Cluster metrics will not be collected on Yarn.  Please use the collectd/hadoop monitor to gain insights to your cluster's health. |
| `collectApplicationMetrics` | no | `bool` |  (**default:** `false`) |
| `enhancedMetrics` | no | `bool` |  (**default:** `false`) |

### Non-default metrics (version 4.7.0+)

**The following information applies to the agent version 4.7.0+ that has
`enableBuiltInFiltering: true` set on the top level of the agent config.**

To emit metrics that are not _default_, you can add those metrics in the
generic monitor-level `extraMetrics` config option.  Metrics that are derived
from specific configuration options that do not appear in the above list of
metrics do not need to be added to `extraMetrics`.

To see a list of metrics that will be emitted you can run `agent-status
monitors` after configuring this monitor in a running agent instance.

### Legacy non-default metrics (version < 4.7.0)

**The following information only applies to agent version older than 4.7.0. If
you have a newer agent and have set `enableBuiltInFiltering: true` at the top
level of your agent config, see the section above. See upgrade instructions in
[Old-style whitelist filtering](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/docs/monitors/../legacy-filtering.md#old-style-whitelist-filtering).**

If you have a reference to the `whitelist.json` in your agent's top-level
`metricsToExclude` config option, and you want to emit metrics that are not in
that whitelist, then you need to add an item to the top-level
`metricsToInclude` config option to override that whitelist (see [Inclusion
filtering](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/docs/monitors/../legacy-filtering.md#inclusion-filtering).  Or you can just
copy the whitelist.json, modify it, and reference that in `metricsToExclude`.

## Dimensions

The following dimensions may occur on metrics emitted by the monitors. Some
dimensions may be specific to certain metrics.

#### collectd/spark monitor

| Name | Description |
| ---  | ---         |
| `cluster` | set to value corresponding to key `cluster` in configuration file |
| `spark_process` | Either master or worker to differentiate master- and worker- specific metrics like master.apps and worker.coresFree |
