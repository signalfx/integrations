### cpu.user

CPU time spent running in userspace. In order to get a percentage this value must be compared against the sum of all CPU states. If this value is high: 1) A process requires more CPU to run than is available on the server, or 2) There is an application programming error which is causing the CPU to be used unexpectedly.
