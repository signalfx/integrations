### DESCRIPTION

This is the SignalFx CouchDB plugin. Follow these instructions to install the CouchDB plugin for collectd.

The <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/signalfx/collectd-couchdb">couchdb-collectd</a> plugin collects metrics from CouchDB instances by calling the api endpoint: <a target="_blank" href="http://docs.couchdb.org/en/2.1.0/api/server/common.html#stats">stats</a>

#### REQUIREMENTS AND DEPENDENCIES

| Software  | Version        |
|-----------|----------------|
| collectd  |  4.9 or later  |
| python | 2.6 or later |
| CouchDB | 2.0.0 or later |
| Python plugin for collectd | (included with [SignalFx collectd agent](https://github.com/signalfx/integrations/tree/master/collectd)[](sfx_link:sfxcollectd)) |

### FEATURES

#### Built-in dashboards

- **COUCHDB CLUSTER**: Provides a high-level overview of metrics for a single CouchDB cluster.

### USAGE

#### Interpreting Built-in dashboards

- **COUCHDB CLUSTER**:

  - **Number of Nodes**: Total number of active nodes in the cluster.

    [<img src='./img/chart-couchdb-cluster-active-nodes.png' width=200px>](./img/chart-couchdb-cluster-active-nodes.png)

  - **Number of Requests**: Total number of requests handled per second by all the nodes in the cluster.

    [<img src='./img/chart-couchdb-cluster-total-requests.png' width=200px>](./img/chart-couchdb-cluster-total-requests.png)

  - **Request Processing Time**: Average request processing time of all the nodes in the cluster.

    [<img src='./img/chart-couchdb-cluster-request-time.png' width=200px>](./img/chart-couchdb-cluster-request-time.png)

  - **Database Reads and Writes**: Total number of database reads and writes performed by all the nodes in the cluster.

    [<img src='./img/chart-couchdb-cluster-db-reads-writes.png' width=200px>](./img/chart-couchdb-cluster-db-reads-writes.png)

  - **Active Data Usage**: Active data usage percentage. As the CouchDB does only soft deletes, all the deleted records are still present in the database. This chart will indicate the percentage of active data in the database. We recommend you to compact database when the value is below 50%.

  - **Active Docs vs Deleted Docs**: Total number of active and deleted docs present in the cluster.

All metrics reported by the CouchDB collectd plugin will contain the following dimensions by default:

* `node`, name of the node as in the cluster
* `cluster`, human readable cluster name
* `plugin` is always set to `couchdb`
* `plugin_instance` will contain the IP address and the port of the member given in the configuration
