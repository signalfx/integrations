sf.org.numThrottledMetricTimeSeriesCreateCallsByToken:
  brief: Per token number of MTS not processed by Infrastructure Monitoring; exceeded per-minute or
    per-hour MTS creation limit
  description: |
    For each token, the number of metric time series (MTS) Infrastructure Monitoring was unable to
    create because your organization significantly exceeded its per-minute or per-hour
    MTS creation limit.
    The sum of all the values might be less than the value of `sf.org.numThrottledMetricTimeSeriesCreateCalls`.

sf.org.limit.activeTimeSeries:
  brief: Number of active MTS allowed for your organization
  description: |
    As part of your contract, Infrastructure Monitoring lets you have this number of active MTS in your organization. If you
    exceed your limit, Infrastructure Monitoring stops creating new MTS while continuing to add datapoints to existing MTS.

sf.org.limit.metricTimeSeriesCreatedPerMinute:
  brief: Number of MTS you can create per minute
  description: |
    As part of your contract, Infrastructure Monitoring lets you create this number of MTS
    per minute. If you exceed this rate, Infrastructure Monitoring stops creating MTS.

sf.org.limit.hosts:
  brief: Maximum number of hosts that can send data to your organization
  description: |
    Maximum number of hosts that can send data to your organization. If you exceed this limit, Infrastructure Monitoring
    drops datapoints from newly-added hosts but keeps datapoints for existing hosts.

sf.org.limit.containers:
  brief: Maximum number of Docker containers that can send data to your organization
  description: |
    Maximum number of Docker containers that can send data to your organization. If you exceed this limit, Infrastructure Monitoring
    drops datapoints from newly-added containers but keeps datapoints for existing containers.

sf.org.limit.customMetricTimeSeries:
  brief: Maximum number of custom MTS you can create in your organization
  description: |
    Maximum number of custom MTS you can create in your organization. Custom MTS use a metric defined by
    you, rather than a metric defined by an integration. If you exceed this limit, Infrastructure Monitoring stops creating new custom MTS.
