### DESCRIPTION

The Varnish collectd plugin collects metrics from Varnish and sends them to SignalFx.

Varnish Cache is a web application accelerator also known as a caching HTTP reverse proxy. You install it in front of any server that speaks HTTP and configure it to cache the contents. Varnish Cache is really, really fast. It typically speeds up delivery with a factor of 300 - 1000x, depending on your architecture.

#### FEATURES

##### Built-in dashboards

- **Varnish (a)**: Overview of data from all Varnish servers.

- **Varnish**: Focus on a single Varnish server.

### REQUIREMENTS AND DEPENDENCIES

| Software  | Version        |
|-----------|----------------|
| collectd  |  5.1* or later (varnish 4.0+ requires collectd 5.5+)  |


### INSTALLATION

1. On RHEL/CentOS and Amazon Linux systems, run the following command to install this plugin:

         yum install collectd-varnish

1. Download SignalFx's [sample configuration file](https://github.com/signalfx/integrations/blob/master/collectd-varnish/10-varnish.conf) to `/etc/collectd/managed_config`.

1. Modify the sample configuration file to provide values that make sense for your environment, as described in [Configuration](#configuration) below.

1. Restart collectd.

#### Special Instructions for installing Varnish 3 on Ubuntu

Starting with collectd 5.6.1-sfx0, the varnish plugin provided within the SignalFx Package only supports varnish 4.
Follow these steps to add varnish 3 plugin support:

1. Copy the [varnish3.so](https://dl.signalfx.com/debs/collectd-varnish/varnish3.so) file to the collectd library directory `/usr/lib/collectd/`.

1. Update the configuration file `10-varnish.conf` in your `/etc/collectd/managed_config` directory to show `varnish3` instead of `varnish` as the name used by the LoadPlugin.

1. Restart collectd.

Example configuration for Varnish 3 on Ubuntu
```apache
LoadPlugin varnish3
<Plugin "varnish">
  <Instance>
    CollectCache       true
    CollectConnections true
    CollectBackend     true
    CollectSHM         true
    CollectESI         true
    CollectFetch       true
    CollectHCB         true
    CollectSMA         true
    CollectSMS         true
    CollectSM          true
    CollectTotals      true
    CollectWorkers     true
    CollectUptime      true
    CollectVCL         true
    CollectStruct      true
    CollectObjects     true
    CollectSession     true
    CollectVSM         true
  </Instance>
</Plugin>
```

### CONFIGURATION

There is no configuration required for the varnish collectd plugin. The default configuration is setup to bring in data on a large variety of metrics.

If using the sample configuration file [10-varnish.conf](https://github.com/signalfx/integrations/tree/master/collectd-varnish/10-varnish.conf), no additional configuration is required. The following optional settings allow you to configure the metrics that will be sent using this plugin:
