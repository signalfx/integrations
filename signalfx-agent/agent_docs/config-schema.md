# Agent Configuration

The agent is configured primarily by a YAML document conventionally located at
`/etc/signalfx/agent.yaml`.  The location of the config file can be specified
by the `-config` flag to the agent binary (`signalfx-agent`).

## Configuring your endpoint

By default, the Smart Agent will send data to the `us0` realm.
If you are not in this realm, you will need to explicitly set the
`signalFxRealm` option in your config like this:

```
signalFxRealm: YOUR_SIGNALFX_REALM
```

To determine if you are in a different realm and need to
explicitly set the endpoints, check your profile page in the SignalFx
web application.

If you want to explicitly set the ingest, API server, and trace endpoint URLs,
you can set them individually like so:

```
ingestUrl: "https://ingest.YOUR_SIGNALFX_REALM.signalfx.com"
apiUrl: "https://api.YOUR_SIGNALFX_REALM.signalfx.com"
traceEndpointUrl: "https://ingest.YOUR_SIGNALFX_REALM.signalfx.com/v1/trace"
```

They will default to the endpoints for the realm configured in `signalFxRealm`
if not set.


## Config Schema


| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `signalFxAccessToken` | no | string | The access token for the org that should receive the metrics emitted by the agent. |
| `ingestUrl` | no | string | The URL of SignalFx ingest server.  Should be overridden if using the SignalFx Gateway.  If not set, this will be determined by the `signalFxRealm` option below.  If you want to send trace spans to a different location, set the `traceEndpointUrl` option. |
| `traceEndpointUrl` | no | string | The full URL (including path) to the trace ingest server.  If this is not set, all trace spans will be sent to the same place as `ingestUrl` above. |
| `apiUrl` | no | string | The SignalFx API base URL.  If not set, this will determined by the `signalFxRealm` option below. |
| `signalFxRealm` | no | string | The SignalFx Realm that the organization you want to send to is a part of.  This defaults to the original realm (`us0`) but if you are setting up the agent for the first time, you quite likely need to change this. (**default:** `"us0"`) |
| `hostname` | no | string | The hostname that will be reported as the `host` dimension. If blank, this will be auto-determined by the agent based on a reverse lookup of the machine's IP address. |
| `useFullyQualifiedHost` | no | bool | If true (the default), and the `hostname` option is not set, the hostname will be determined by doing a reverse DNS query on the IP address that is returned by querying for the bare hostname.  This is useful in cases where the hostname reported by the kernel is a short name. (**default**: `true`) |
| `disableHostDimensions` | no | bool | Our standard agent model is to collect metrics for services running on the same host as the agent.  Therefore, host-specific dimensions (e.g. `host`, `AWSUniqueId`, etc) are automatically added to every datapoint that is emitted from the agent by default.  Set this to true if you are using the agent primarily to monitor things on other hosts.  You can set this option at the monitor level as well. (**default:** `false`) |
| `intervalSeconds` | no | integer | How often to send metrics to SignalFx.  Monitors can override this individually. (**default:** `10`) |
| `globalDimensions` | no | map of strings | Dimensions (key:value pairs) that will be added to every datapoint emitted by the agent. To specify that all metrics should be high-resolution, add the dimension `sf_hires: 1` |
| `sendMachineID` | no | bool | Whether to send the machine-id dimension on all host-specific datapoints generated by the agent.  This dimension is derived from the Linux machine-id value. (**default:** `false`) |
| `cluster` | no | string | The logical environment/cluster that this agent instance is running in. All of the services that this instance monitors should be in the same environment as well. This value, if provided, will be synced as a property onto the `host` dimension, or onto any cloud-provided specific dimensions (`AWSUniqueId`, `gcp_id`, and `azure_resource_id`) when available. Example values: "prod-usa", "dev" |
| `syncClusterOnHostDimension` | no | bool | If true, force syncing of the `cluster` property on the `host` dimension, even when cloud-specific dimensions are present. (**default:** `false`) |
| `validateDiscoveryRules` | no | bool | If true, a warning will be emitted if a discovery rule contains variables that will never possibly match a rule.  If using multiple observers, it is convenient to set this to false to suppress spurious errors. (**default:** `true`) |
| `observers` | no | [list of objects (see below)](#observers) | A list of observers to use (see observer config) |
| `monitors` | no | [list of objects (see below)](#monitors) | A list of monitors to use (see monitor config) |
| `writer` | no | [object (see below)](#writer) | Configuration of the datapoint/event writer |
| `logging` | no | [object (see below)](#logging) | Log configuration |
| `collectd` | no | [object (see below)](#collectd) | Configuration of the managed collectd subprocess |
| `enableBuiltInFiltering` | no | bool | If true, the agent will filter out [custom metrics](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/admin-guide/usage.html#about-custom-bundled-and-high-resolution-metrics) without having to rely on the `whitelist.json` filter that was previously configured under `metricsToExclude`.  Whether a metric is custom or not is documented in each monitor's documentation.  If `true`, every monitor's default configuration (i.e. the minimum amount of configuration to make it work) will only send non-custom metrics.  In order to send out custom metrics from a monitor, certain config flags on the monitor must be set _or_ you can specify the metric in the `extraMetrics` config option on each monitor if you know the specific metric name.  You would not have to modify the whitelist via `metricsToInclude` as before.  If you set this option to `true`, the `whitelist.json` entry under `metricToExclude` should be removed, if it is present -- otherwise custom metrics won't be emitted. (**default:** `false`) |
| `metricsToInclude` | no | [list of objects (see below)](#metricstoinclude) | A list of metric filters that will whitelist/include metrics.  These filters take priority over the filters specified in `metricsToExclude`. |
| `metricsToExclude` | no | [list of objects (see below)](#metricstoexclude) | A list of metric filters |
| `propertiesToExclude` | no | [list of objects (see below)](#propertiestoexclude) | A list of properties filters |
| `internalStatusHost` | no | string | The host on which the internal status server will listen.  The internal status HTTP server serves internal metrics and diagnostic information about the agent and can be scraped by the `internal-metrics` monitor. Can be set to `0.0.0.0` if you want to monitor the agent from another host.  If you set this to blank/null, the internal status server will not be started.  See `internalStatusPort`. (**default:** `"localhost"`) |
| `internalStatusPort` | no | integer | The port on which the internal status server will listen.  See `internalStatusHost`. (**default:** `8095`) |
| `profiling` | no | bool | Enables Go pprof endpoint on port 6060 that serves profiling data for development (**default:** `false`) |
| `profilingHost` | no | string | The host/ip address for the pprof profile server to listen on. `profiling` must be enabled for this to have any effect. (**default:** `"127.0.0.1"`) |
| `profilingPort` | no | integer | The port for the pprof profile server to listen on. `profiling` must be enabled for this to have any effect. (**default:** `6060`) |
| `bundleDir` | no | string | Path to the directory holding the agent dependencies.  This will normally be derived automatically. Overrides the envvar SIGNALFX_BUNDLE_DIR if set. |
| `scratch` | no | any | This exists purely to give the user a place to put common yaml values to reference in other parts of the config file. |
| `configSources` | no | [object (see below)](#configsources) | Configuration of remote config stores |
| `procPath` | no | string | Path to the host's `/proc` filesystem. This is useful for containerized environments. (**default:** `"/proc"`) |
| `etcPath` | no | string | Path to the host's `/etc` directory. This is useful for containerized environments. (**default:** `"/etc"`) |
| `varPath` | no | string | Path to the host's `/var` directory. This is useful for containerized environments. (**default:** `"/var"`) |
| `runPath` | no | string | Path to the host's `/run` directory. This is useful for containerized environments. (**default:** `"/run"`) |
| `sysPath` | no | string | Path to the host's `/sys` directory. This is useful for containerized environments. (**default:** `"/sys"`) |


## observers
The **nested** `observers` config object has the following fields:

The following are generic options that apply to all observers.  Each observer type has its own set of additional configuration options, detailed in [Observer Config](./observer-config.md).

| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | no | string | The type of the observer |



## monitors
The **nested** `monitors` config object has the following fields:

The following are generic options that apply to all monitors.  Each monitor type has its own set of additional configuration options, detailed in [Monitor Config](./monitor-config.md).

| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | no | string | The type of the monitor |
| `discoveryRule` | no | string | The rule used to match up this configuration with a discovered endpoint. If blank, the configuration will be run immediately when the agent is started.  If multiple endpoints match this rule, multiple instances of the monitor type will be created with the same configuration (except different host/port). |
| `validateDiscoveryRule` | no | bool | If true, a warning will be emitted if a discovery rule contains variables that will never possibly match a rule.  If using multiple observers, it is convenient to set this to false to suppress spurious errors.  The top-level setting `validateDiscoveryRules` acts as a default if this isn't set. (**default:** `"false"`) |
| `extraDimensions` | no | map of strings | A set of extra dimensions (key:value pairs) to include on datapoints emitted by the monitor(s) created from this configuration. To specify metrics from this monitor should be high-resolution, add the dimension `sf_hires: 1` |
| `extraDimensionsFromEndpoint` | no | map of strings | A mapping of extra dimension names to a [discovery rule expression](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/integrations/agent/auto-discovery.html) that is used to derive the value of the dimension.  For example, to use a certain container label as a dimension, you could use something like this in your monitor config block: `extraDimensionsFromEndpoint: {env: 'Get(container_labels, "myapp.com/environment")'}` |
| `configEndpointMappings` | no | map of strings | A set of mappings from a configuration option on this monitor to attributes of a discovered endpoint.  The keys are the config option on this monitor and the value can be any valid expression used in discovery rules. |
| `intervalSeconds` | no | integer | The interval (in seconds) at which to emit datapoints from the monitor(s) created by this configuration.  If not set (or set to 0), the global agent intervalSeconds config option will be used instead. (**default:** `0`) |
| `solo` | no | bool | If one or more configurations have this set to true, only those configurations will be considered. This setting can be useful for testing. (**default:** `false`) |
| `metricsToExclude` | no | [list of objects (see below)](#metricstoexclude) | DEPRECATED in favor of the `datapointsToExclude` option.  That option handles negation of filter items differently. |
| `datapointsToExclude` | no | [list of objects (see below)](#datapointstoexclude) | A list of datapoint filters.  These filters allow you to comprehensively define which datapoints to exclude by metric name or dimension set, as well as the ability to define overrides to re-include metrics excluded by previous patterns within the same filter item.  See [monitor filtering](./filtering.html#additional-monitor-level-filtering) for examples and more information. |
| `disableHostDimensions` | no | bool | Some monitors pull metrics from services not running on the same host and should not get the host-specific dimensions set on them (e.g. `host`, `AWSUniqueId`, etc).  Setting this to `true` causes those dimensions to be omitted.  You can disable this globally with the `disableHostDimensions` option on the top level of the config. (**default:** `false`) |
| `disableEndpointDimensions` | no | bool | This can be set to true if you don't want to include the dimensions that are specific to the endpoint that was discovered by an observer.  This is useful when you have an endpoint whose identity is not particularly important since it acts largely as a proxy or adapter for other metrics. (**default:** `false`) |
| `dimensionTransformations` | no | map of strings | A map from dimension names emitted by the monitor to the desired dimension name that will be emitted in the datapoint that goes to SignalFx.  This can be useful if you have custom metrics from your applications and want to make the dimensions from a monitor match those. Also can be useful when scraping free-form metrics, say with the `prometheus-exporter` monitor.  Right now, only static key/value transformations are supported.  Note that filtering by dimensions will be done on the *original* dimension name and not the new name. Note that it is possible to remove unwanted dimensions via this configuration, by making the desired dimension name an empty string. |
| `extraMetrics` | no | list of strings | Extra metrics to enable besides the default included ones.  This is an [overridable filter](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/integrations/agent/filtering.html#overridable-filtering). |
| `extraGroups` | no | list of strings | Extra metric groups to enable in addition to the metrics that are emitted by default.  A metric group is simply a collection of metrics, and they are defined in each monitor's documentation. |


## metricsToExclude
The **nested** `metricsToExclude` config object has the following fields:

For more information on filtering see [Datapoint Filtering](./filtering.md).


| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `dimensions` | no | map of any | A map of dimension key/values to match against.  All key/values must match a datapoint for it to be matched.  The map values can be either a single string or a list of strings. |
| `metricNames` | no | list of strings | A list of metric names to match against |
| `metricName` | no | string | A single metric name to match against |
| `monitorType` | no | string | (**Only applicable for the top level filters**) Limits this scope of the filter to datapoints from a specific monitor. If specified, any datapoints not from this monitor type will never match against this filter. |
| `negated` | no | bool | (**Only applicable for the top level filters**) Negates the result of the match so that it matches all datapoints that do NOT match the metric name and dimension values given. This does not negate monitorType, if given. (**default:** `false`) |



## datapointsToExclude
The **nested** `datapointsToExclude` config object has the following fields:



| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `dimensions` | no | map of any | A map of dimension key/values to match against.  All key/values must match a datapoint for it to be matched.  The map values can be either a single string or a list of strings. |
| `metricNames` | no | list of strings | A list of metric names to match against |
| `metricName` | no | string | A single metric name to match against |
| `monitorType` | no | string | (**Only applicable for the top level filters**) Limits this scope of the filter to datapoints from a specific monitor. If specified, any datapoints not from this monitor type will never match against this filter. |
| `negated` | no | bool | (**Only applicable for the top level filters**) Negates the result of the match so that it matches all datapoints that do NOT match the metric name and dimension values given. This does not negate monitorType, if given. (**default:** `false`) |




## writer
The **nested** `writer` config object has the following fields:



| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `datapointMaxBatchSize` | no | integer | The maximum number of datapoints to include in a batch before sending the batch to the ingest server.  Smaller batch sizes than this will be sent if datapoints originate in smaller chunks. (**default:** `1000`) |
| `maxDatapointsBuffered` | no | integer | The maximum number of datapoints that are allowed to be buffered in the agent (i.e. received from a monitor but have not yet received confirmation of successful receipt by the target ingest/gateway server downstream).  Any datapoints that come in beyond this number will overwrite existing datapoints if they have not been sent yet, starting with the oldest. (**default:** `25000`) |
| `traceSpanMaxBatchSize` | no | integer | The analogue of `datapointMaxBatchSize` for trace spans. (**default:** `1000`) |
| `datapointMaxRequests` | no | integer | Deprecated: use `maxRequests` instead. (**default:** `0`) |
| `maxRequests` | no | integer | The maximum number of concurrent requests to make to a single ingest server with datapoints/events/trace spans.  This number multiplied by `datapointMaxBatchSize` is more or less the maximum number of datapoints that can be "in-flight" at any given time.  Same thing for the `traceSpanMaxBatchSize` option and trace spans. (**default:** `10`) |
| `eventSendIntervalSeconds` | no | integer | The agent does not send events immediately upon a monitor generating them, but buffers them and sends them in batches.  The lower this number, the less delay for events to appear in SignalFx. (**default:** `1`) |
| `propertiesMaxRequests` | no | unsigned integer | The analogue of `maxRequests` for dimension property requests. (**default:** `20`) |
| `propertiesMaxBuffered` | no | unsigned integer | How many dimension property updates to hold pending being sent before dropping subsequent property updates.  Property updates will be resent eventually and they are slow to change so dropping them (esp on agent start up) usually isn't a big deal. (**default:** `10000`) |
| `propertiesSendDelaySeconds` | no | unsigned integer | How long to wait for property updates to be sent once they are generated.  Any duplicate updates to the same dimension within this time frame will result in the latest property set being sent.  This helps prevent spurious updates that get immediately overwritten by very flappy property generation. (**default:** `30`) |
| `propertiesHistorySize` | no | unsigned integer | Properties that are synced to SignalFx are cached to prevent duplicate requests from being sent, causing unnecessary load on our backend. (**default:** `10000`) |
| `logDatapoints` | no | bool | If the log level is set to `debug` and this is true, all datapoints generated by the agent will be logged. (**default:** `false`) |
| `logEvents` | no | bool | The analogue of `logDatapoints` for events. (**default:** `false`) |
| `logTraceSpans` | no | bool | The analogue of `logDatapoints` for trace spans. (**default:** `false`) |
| `logDimensionUpdates` | no | bool | If `true`, dimension updates will be logged at the INFO level. (**default:** `false`) |
| `logDroppedDatapoints` | no | bool | If true, and the log level is `debug`, filtered out datapoints will be logged. (**default:** `false`) |
| `sendTraceHostCorrelationMetrics` | no | bool | Whether to send host correlation metrics to correlation traced services with the underlying host (**default:** `true`) |
| `staleServiceTimeout` | no | int64 | How long to wait after a trace span's service name is last seen to continue sending the correlation datapoints for that service.  This should be a duration string that is accepted by https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration.  This option is irrelvant if `sendTraceHostCorrelationMetrics` is false. (**default:** `"5m"`) |
| `traceHostCorrelationMetricsInterval` | no | int64 | How frequently to send host correlation metrics that are generated from the service name seen in trace spans sent through or by the agent.  This should be a duration string that is accepted by https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration.  This option is irrelvant if `sendTraceHostCorrelationMetrics` is false. (**default:** `"1m"`) |
| `maxTraceSpansInFlight` | no | unsigned integer | How many trace spans are allowed to be in the process of sending.  While this number is exceeded, the oldest spans will be discarded to accommodate new spans generated to avoid memory exhaustion.  If you see log messages about "Aborting pending trace requests..." or "Dropping new trace spans..." it means that the downstream target for traces is not able to accept them fast enough. Usually if the downstream is offline you will get connection refused errors and most likely spans will not build up in the agent (there is no retry mechanism). In the case of slow downstreams, you might be able to increase `maxRequests` to increase the concurrent stream of spans downstream (if the target can make efficient use of additional connections) or, less likely, increase `traceSpanMaxBatchSize` if your batches are maxing out (turn on debug logging to see the batch sizes being sent) and being split up too much. If neither of those options helps, your downstream is likely too slow to handle the volume of trace spans and should be upgraded to more powerful hardware/networking. (**default:** `100000`) |



## logging
The **nested** `logging` config object has the following fields:



| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `level` | no | string | Valid levels include `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`.  Note that `debug` logging may leak sensitive configuration (e.g. passwords) to the agent output. (**default:** `"info"`) |
| `format` | no | string | The log output format to use.  Valid values are: `text`, `json`. (**default:** `"text"`) |



## collectd
The **nested** `collectd` config object has the following fields:



| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `disableCollectd` | no | bool | If you won't be using any collectd monitors, this can be set to true to prevent collectd from pre-initializing (**default:** `false`) |
| `timeout` | no | integer | How many read intervals before abandoning a metric. Doesn't affect much in normal usage. See [Timeout](https://collectd.org/documentation/manpages/collectd.conf.5.shtml#timeout_iterations). (**default:** `40`) |
| `readThreads` | no | integer | Number of threads dedicated to executing read callbacks. See [ReadThreads](https://collectd.org/documentation/manpages/collectd.conf.5.shtml#readthreads_num) (**default:** `5`) |
| `writeThreads` | no | integer | Number of threads dedicated to writing value lists to write callbacks. This should be much less than readThreads because writing is batched in the write_http plugin that writes back to the agent. See [WriteThreads](https://collectd.org/documentation/manpages/collectd.conf.5.shtml#writethreads_num). (**default:** `2`) |
| `writeQueueLimitHigh` | no | integer | The maximum numbers of values in the queue to be written back to the agent from collectd.  Since the values are written to a local socket that the agent exposes, there should be almost no queuing and the default should be more than sufficient. See [WriteQueueLimitHigh](https://collectd.org/documentation/manpages/collectd.conf.5.shtml#writequeuelimithigh_highnum) (**default:** `500000`) |
| `writeQueueLimitLow` | no | integer | The lowest number of values in the collectd queue before which metrics begin being randomly dropped.  See [WriteQueueLimitLow](https://collectd.org/documentation/manpages/collectd.conf.5.shtml#writequeuelimitlow_lownum) (**default:** `400000`) |
| `logLevel` | no | string | Collectd's log level -- info, notice, warning, or err (**default:** `"notice"`) |
| `intervalSeconds` | no | integer | A default read interval for collectd plugins.  If zero or undefined, will default to the global agent interval.  Some collectd python monitors do not support overridding the interval at the monitor level, but this setting will apply to them. (**default:** `0`) |
| `writeServerIPAddr` | no | string | The local IP address of the server that the agent exposes to which collectd will send metrics.  This defaults to an arbitrary address in the localhost subnet, but can be overridden if needed. (**default:** `"127.9.8.7"`) |
| `writeServerPort` | no | integer | The port of the agent's collectd metric sink server.  If set to zero (the default) it will allow the OS to assign it a free port. (**default:** `0`) |
| `configDir` | no | string | This is where the agent will write the collectd config files that it manages.  If you have secrets in those files, consider setting this to a path on a tmpfs mount.  The files in this directory should be considered transient -- there is no value in editing them by hand.  If you want to add your own collectd config, see the collectd/custom monitor. (**default:** `"/var/run/signalfx-agent/collectd"`) |



## metricsToInclude
The **nested** `metricsToInclude` config object has the following fields:



| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `dimensions` | no | map of any | A map of dimension key/values to match against.  All key/values must match a datapoint for it to be matched.  The map values can be either a single string or a list of strings. |
| `metricNames` | no | list of strings | A list of metric names to match against |
| `metricName` | no | string | A single metric name to match against |
| `monitorType` | no | string | (**Only applicable for the top level filters**) Limits this scope of the filter to datapoints from a specific monitor. If specified, any datapoints not from this monitor type will never match against this filter. |
| `negated` | no | bool | (**Only applicable for the top level filters**) Negates the result of the match so that it matches all datapoints that do NOT match the metric name and dimension values given. This does not negate monitorType, if given. (**default:** `false`) |



## metricsToExclude
The **nested** `metricsToExclude` config object has the following fields:

For more information on filtering see [Datapoint Filtering](./filtering.md).


| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `dimensions` | no | map of any | A map of dimension key/values to match against.  All key/values must match a datapoint for it to be matched.  The map values can be either a single string or a list of strings. |
| `metricNames` | no | list of strings | A list of metric names to match against |
| `metricName` | no | string | A single metric name to match against |
| `monitorType` | no | string | (**Only applicable for the top level filters**) Limits this scope of the filter to datapoints from a specific monitor. If specified, any datapoints not from this monitor type will never match against this filter. |
| `negated` | no | bool | (**Only applicable for the top level filters**) Negates the result of the match so that it matches all datapoints that do NOT match the metric name and dimension values given. This does not negate monitorType, if given. (**default:** `false`) |



## propertiesToExclude
The **nested** `propertiesToExclude` config object has the following fields:



| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `propertyName` | no | string | A single property name to match (**default:** `"*"`) |
| `propertyValue` | no | string | A property value to match (**default:** `"*"`) |
| `dimensionName` | no | string | A dimension name to match (**default:** `"*"`) |
| `dimensionValue` | no | string | A dimension value to match (**default:** `"*"`) |



## configSources
The **nested** `configSources` config object has the following fields:

For more information about how to use config sources, see [Remote Config](./remote-config.md).

| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `watch` | no | bool | Whether to watch config sources for changes.  If this is `true` and any of the config changes (either the main agent.yaml, or remote config values), the agent will dynamically reconfigure itself with minimal disruption.  This is generally better than restarting the agent on config changes since that can result in larger gaps in metric data.  The main disadvantage of watching is slightly greater network and compute resource usage. This option is not itself watched for changes. If you change the value of this option, you must restart the agent. (**default:** `true`) |
| `file` | no | [object (see below)](#file) | Configuration for other file sources |
| `zookeeper` | no | [object (see below)](#zookeeper) | Configuration for a Zookeeper remote config source |
| `etcd2` | no | [object (see below)](#etcd2) | Configuration for an Etcd 2 remote config source |
| `consul` | no | [object (see below)](#consul) | Configuration for a Consul remote config source |
| `vault` | no | [object (see below)](#vault) | Configuration for a Hashicorp Vault remote config source |


## file
The **nested** `file` config object has the following fields:



| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `pollRateSeconds` | no | integer | How often to poll files (in seconds) to test for changes.  There are so many edge cases that break inotify that it is more robust to simply poll files than rely on that. This option is not subject to watching and changes to it will require an agent restart. (**default:** `5`) |



## zookeeper
The **nested** `zookeeper` config object has the following fields:



| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `endpoints` | no | list of strings | A list of Zookeeper servers to use for the client |
| `timeoutSeconds` | no | unsigned integer | Client timeout (**default:** `10`) |



## etcd2
The **nested** `etcd2` config object has the following fields:



| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `endpoints` | no | list of strings | A list of Etcd2 servers to use |
| `username` | no | string | An optional username to use when connecting |
| `password` | no | string | An optional password to use when connecting |



## consul
The **nested** `consul` config object has the following fields:



| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `endpoint` | no | string | A Consul server URL |
| `username` | no | string | An optional username to use when connecting |
| `password` | no | string | An optional password to use when connecting |
| `token` | no | string | An authentication token, if needed |
| `datacenter` | no | string | The Consul datacenter to use |



## vault
The **nested** `vault` config object has the following fields:



| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `vaultAddr` | no | string | The Vault Address.  Can also be provided by the standard Vault envvar `VAULT_ADDR`.  This option takes priority over the envvar if provided. |
| `vaultToken` | no | string | The Vault token, can also be provided by it the standard Vault envvar `VAULT_TOKEN`.  This option takes priority over the envvar if provided. |
| `kvV2PollInterval` | no | int64 | The polling interval for checking KV V2 secrets for a new version.  This can be any string value that can be parsed by https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration. (**default:** `"60s"`) |
| `authMethod` | no | string | The authetication method to use, if any, to obtain the Vault token.  If `vaultToken` is specified above, this option will have no effect. Currently supported values are: `iam`. |
| `iam` | no | [object (see below)](#iam) | Further config options for the `iam` auth method.  These options are identical to the [CLI helper tool options](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/blob/v1.1.0/builtin/credential/aws/cli.go#L148) |
| `gcp` | no | [object (see below)](#gcp) | Further config options for the `gcp` auth method. These options are identical to the [CLI helper tool options](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault-plugin-auth-gcp/blob/e1f6784b379d277038ca0661606aa8d23791e392/plugin/cli.go#L120). You must provide a valid GCP IAM credential JSON either explicitly via the `credentials` option (not recommended), or through any GCP Application Default Credentials. |


## iam
The **nested** `iam` config object has the following fields:



| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `awsAccessKeyId` | no | string | Explicit AWS access key ID |
| `awsSecretAccessKey` | no | string | Explicit AWS secret access key |
| `awsSecurityToken` | no | string | Explicit AWS security token for temporary credentials |
| `headerValue` | no | string | Value for the x-vault-aws-iam-server-id header in requests |
| `mount` | no | string | Path where the AWS credential method is mounted. This is usually provided via the -path flag in the "vault login" command, but it can be specified here as well. If specified here, it takes precedence over the value for -path. The default value is "aws". |
| `role` | no | string | Name of the Vault role to request a token against |



## gcp
The **nested** `gcp` config object has the following fields:



| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `role` | no | string | Required. The name of the role you're requesting a token for. |
| `mount` | no | string | This is usually provided via the -path flag in the "vault login" command, but it can be specified here as well. If specified here, it takes precedence over the value for -path.  Defaults to `gcp`. |
| `credentials` | no | string | Explicitly specified GCP credentials in JSON string format (not recommended) |
| `jwt_exp` | no | integer | Time until the generated JWT expires in minutes. The given IAM role will have a max_jwt_exp field, the time in minutes that all valid authentication JWTs must expire within (from time of authentication). Defaults to 15 minutes, the default max_jwt_exp for a role. Must be less than an hour. |
| `service_account` | no | string | Service account to generate a JWT for. Defaults to credentials "client_email" if "credentials" specified and this value is not. The actual credential must have the "iam.serviceAccounts.signJWT" permissions on this service account. |
| `project` | no | string | Project for the service account who will be authenticating to Vault. Defaults to the credential's "project_id" (if credentials are specified)." |
