# Quick Install


The SignalFx Smart Agent is a metric-based agent written in Go that is used to monitor infrastructure and application services from a variety of environments.

The Smart Agent contains three main components:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Monitors  |  This component collects metrics from the host and applications. For a list of supported monitors and their configurations, see [Monitor Configuration](./monitor-config.md).            |
| Observers |   This component collects metrics from services that are running in your environment. For a list of supported observers and their configurations, see [Observer Configuration](./observer-config.md).           |
| Writer    |   This component collects metrics from configured monitors and then sends these metrics to SignalFx on a regular basis. If you are expecting your monitors to send large volumes of metrics through a single agent, then you must update the configurations. To learn more, see [Agent Configurations](./config-schema.html#writer).          |

## Installation

### Review pre-installation requirements for the Smart Agent

Before you download and install the Smart Agent on a **single** host, review the requirements below.

(For other installation options, including bulk deployments, see [Advanced Installation Options](./advanced-install-options.md).)

Please note that the Smart Agent does not support Mac OS.  

**General requirements**
- You must have access to your command line interface.
- You must uninstall or disable any previously installed collector agent from your host, such as collectd.

**Linux requirements**
- You must run kernel version 2.6 or higher for your Linux distribution.

**Windows requirements**
- You must run .Net Framework 3.5 on Windows 8 or higher.
- (Optional) If you want to invoke a Python script for non-default monitors, specifically **exec**, then you must have Python installed.


### Step 1. Install the SignalFx Smart Agent on your host

#### Linux

Note: This content appears on a SignalFx documentation page and on the **Setup** tab of the Smart Agent tile in the SignalFx UI. The following code to install the current version works only if you are viewing these instructions on the **Setup** tab.  

From the **Setup** tab, copy and paste the following code into your command line or terminal:


```sh
curl -sSL https://dl.signalfx.com/signalfx-agent.sh > /tmp/signalfx-agent.sh
sudo sh /tmp/signalfx-agent.sh --realm YOUR_SIGNALFX_REALM -- YOUR_SIGNALFX_API_TOKEN
```



#### Windows

Note: This content appears on a SignalFx documentation page and on the **Setup** tab of the Smart Agent tile in the SignalFx UI. The following code to install the current version works only if you are viewing these instructions on the **Setup** tab.  

From the **Setup** tab, copy and paste the following code into your PowerShell window:


```sh
& {Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; $script = ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://dl.signalfx.com/signalfx-agent.ps1')); $params = @{access_token = "YOUR_SIGNALFX_API_TOKEN"; ingest_url = "https://ingest.YOUR_SIGNALFX_REALM.signalfx.com"; api_url = "https://api.YOUR_SIGNALFX_REALM.signalfx.com"}; Invoke-Command -ScriptBlock ([scriptblock]::Create(". {$script} $(&{$args} @params)"))}
```

The agent will be installed as a Windows service and will log to the Windows Event Log.


### Step 2. Confirm your Installation


1. To confirm your installation, enter the following command on the Linux or Windows command line:

    ```sh
    sudo signalfx-agent status
    ```

    The return should be similar to the following example:  

    ```sh
    SignalFx Agent version:           4.7.6
    Agent uptime:                     8m44s
    Observers active:                 host
    Active Monitors:                  16
    Configured Monitors:              33
    Discovered Endpoint Count:        6
    Bad Monitor Config:               None
    Global Dimensions:                {host: my-host-1}
    Datapoints sent (last minute):    1614
    Events Sent (last minute):        0
    Trace Spans Sent (last minute):   0
    ```

2. To confirm your installation, enter the following command on the Linux or Windows command line:

    | Command | Description   |
    |---|---|
    | <code>signalfx-agent status config</code>   | This command shows resolved config in use by the Smart Agent. |
    | <code>signalfx-agent status endpoints</code>  | This command shows discovered endpoints.  |
    | <code>signalfx-agent status monitors</code>  | This command shows active monitors.  |
    | <code>signalfx-agent status all</code>  | This command shows all of the above statuses. |


### Troubleshoot the Smart Agent installation

If you are unable to install the Smart Agent, consider reviewing your error logs:

For Linux, use the following command to view error logs via Journal:

```sh
journalctl -u signalfx-agent | tail -100
```

For Windows, review the event logs.

For additional installation troubleshooting information, including how to review logs, see [Frequently Asked Questions](./faq.md).

### Review additional documentation

After a successful installation, learn more about the SignalFx agent and the SignalFx UI.

* Review the capabilities of the SignalFx Smart Agent. See [Advanced Installation Options](./advanced-install-options.md).

* Learn how data is displayed in the SignalFx UI. See [View infrastructure status](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/getting-started/quick-start.html#step-3-view-infrastructure-status).
