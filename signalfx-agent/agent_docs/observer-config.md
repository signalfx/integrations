# Observer Configuration

Observers are what discover service endpoints that can then be monitored.  They
are configured in a list called `observers` in the [main agent config
file](./config-schema.md). These are all of the observers included in the agent
along with their possible configuration options:

- [docker](./observers/docker.md)
- [ecs](./observers/ecs.md)
- [host](./observers/host.md)
- [k8s-api](./observers/k8s-api.md)
- [k8s-kubelet](./observers/k8s-kubelet.md)


## Common Configuration

The following config options are common to all observers:

| Config option | Default | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `type` |  | no | `string` | The type of the observer |
