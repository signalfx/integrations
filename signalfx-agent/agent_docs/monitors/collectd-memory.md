This monitor has no configuration options.
## Metrics

These are the metrics available for this monitor.
Metrics that are categorized as
[container/host](https://docs.splunk.com/observability/admin/subscription-usage/monitor-imm-billing-usage.html#about-custom-bundled-and-high-resolution-metrics)
(*default*) are ***in bold and italics*** in the list below.


 - ***`memory.buffered`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Bytes of memory used for buffering I/O
 - ***`memory.cached`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Bytes of memory used for disk caching
 - ***`memory.free`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Bytes of memory available for use
 - ***`memory.slab_recl`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Bytes of memory, used for SLAB-allocation of kernel objects, that can be reclaimed.
 - ***`memory.slab_unrecl`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Bytes of memory, used for SLAB-allocation of kernel objects, that can't be reclaimed
 - ***`memory.used`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Bytes of memory in use by the system.

### Non-default metrics (version 4.7.0+)

To emit metrics that are not _default_, you can add those metrics in the
generic monitor-level `extraMetrics` config option.  Metrics that are derived
from specific configuration options that do not appear in the above list of
metrics do not need to be added to `extraMetrics`.

To see a list of metrics that will be emitted you can run `agent-status
monitors` after configuring this monitor in a running agent instance.
