# collectd/zookeeper

Monitor Type: `collectd/zookeeper` ([Source](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/internal/monitors/collectd/zookeeper))

**Accepts Endpoints**: **Yes**

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: Yes

## Overview

Monitors an Apache Zookeeper instance using the [Zookeeper collectd
plugin](https://github.com/signalfx/collectd-zookeeper). This plugin is
installed with the Smart Agent so no additional installation is required to
use this monitor.  Supports Zookeeper 3.4.0 or later.


## Configuration

To activate this monitor in the Smart Agent, add the following to your
agent config:

```
monitors:  # All monitor config goes under this key
 - type: collectd/zookeeper
   ...  # Additional config
```

**For a list of monitor options that are common to all monitors, see [Common
Configuration](../monitor-config.html#common-configuration).**


| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `pythonBinary` | no | `string` | Path to a python binary that should be used to execute the Python code. If not set, a built-in runtime will be used.  Can include arguments to the binary as well. |
| `host` | **yes** | `string` | Host or IP address of the Zookeeper node |
| `port` | **yes** | `integer` | Main port of the Zookeeper node |
| `name` | no | `string` | This will be the value of the `plugin_instance` dimension on emitted metrics, if provided. |


## Metrics

These are the metrics available for this monitor.
Metrics that are categorized as
[container/host](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/admin-guide/usage.html#about-custom-bundled-and-high-resolution-metrics)
(*default*) are ***in bold and italics*** in the list below.


 - `counter.zk_fsync_threshold_exceed_count` (*cumulative*)<br>    Number of times fsync duration has exceeded warning threshold
 - ***`counter.zk_packets_received`*** (*cumulative*)<br>    Count of the number of ZooKeeper packets received by a server
 - ***`counter.zk_packets_sent`*** (*cumulative*)<br>    Count of the number of ZooKeeper packets sent from a server
 - ***`gauge.zk_approximate_data_size`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Size of data in bytes that a ZooKeeper server has in its data tree
 - ***`gauge.zk_avg_latency`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Average time in milliseconds for requests to be processed
 - ***`gauge.zk_ephemerals_count`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Number of ephemeral nodes that a ZooKeeper server has in its data tree
 - `gauge.zk_is_leader` (*gauge*)<br>    1 if the node is a leader, 0 if the node is a follower
 - ***`gauge.zk_max_file_descriptor_count`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Maximum number of file descriptors that a ZooKeeper server can open
 - `gauge.zk_max_latency` (*gauge*)<br>    Maximum time in milliseconds for a request to be processed
 - `gauge.zk_min_latency` (*gauge*)<br>    Minimum time in milliseconds for a request to be processed
 - ***`gauge.zk_num_alive_connections`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Number of active clients connected to a ZooKeeper server
 - ***`gauge.zk_open_file_descriptor_count`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Number of file descriptors that a ZooKeeper server has open
 - `gauge.zk_outstanding_requests` (*gauge*)<br>    Number of currently executing requests
 - `gauge.zk_service_health` (*gauge*)<br>    1 if server is running, otherwise 0
 - ***`gauge.zk_watch_count`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Number of watches placed on Z-Nodes on a ZooKeeper server
 - ***`gauge.zk_znode_count`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Number of z-nodes that a ZooKeeper server has in its data tree

### Non-default metrics (version 4.7.0+)

**The following information applies to the agent version 4.7.0+ that has
`enableBuiltInFiltering: true` set on the top level of the agent config.**

To emit metrics that are not _default_, you can add those metrics in the
generic monitor-level `extraMetrics` config option.  Metrics that are derived
from specific configuration options that do not appear in the above list of
metrics do not need to be added to `extraMetrics`.

To see a list of metrics that will be emitted you can run `agent-status
monitors` after configuring this monitor in a running agent instance.

### Legacy non-default metrics (version < 4.7.0)

**The following information only applies to agent version older than 4.7.0. If
you have a newer agent and have set `enableBuiltInFiltering: true` at the top
level of your agent config, see the section above. See upgrade instructions in
[Old-style whitelist filtering](../legacy-filtering.html#old-style-whitelist-filtering).**

If you have a reference to the `whitelist.json` in your agent's top-level
`metricsToExclude` config option, and you want to emit metrics that are not in
that whitelist, then you need to add an item to the top-level
`metricsToInclude` config option to override that whitelist (see [Inclusion
filtering](../legacy-filtering.html#inclusion-filtering).  Or you can just
copy the whitelist.json, modify it, and reference that in `metricsToExclude`.
