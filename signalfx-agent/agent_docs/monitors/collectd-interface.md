# collectd/interface

Monitor Type: `collectd/interface` ([Source](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/pkg/monitors/collectd/netinterface))

**Accepts Endpoints**: No

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: **No**

## Overview

Collectd stats about network interfaces on the
system by using the [collectd interface
plugin](https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:Interface).

**This monitor is deprecated in favor of the `net-io` monitor. Please
switch to that monitor as this monitor will be removed in a future release
of the agent.**  Note that the `net-io` monitor uses the `interface`
dimension to identify the network card instead of the `plugin_instance`
dimension, but otherwise the metrics are the same.


## Configuration

To activate this monitor in the Smart Agent, add the following to your
agent config:

```
monitors:  # All monitor config goes under this key
 - type: collectd/interface
   ...  # Additional config
```

**For a list of monitor options that are common to all monitors, see [Common
Configuration](../monitor-config.html#common-configuration).**


| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `excludedInterfaces` | no | `list of strings` | List of interface names to exclude from monitoring (**default:** `[/^lo\d*$/ /^docker.*/ /^t(un|ap)\d*$/ /^veth.*$/]`) |
| `includedInterfaces` | no | `list of strings` | List of all the interfaces you want to monitor, all others will be ignored.  If you set both included and excludedInterfaces, only includedInterfaces will be honored. |


## Metrics

These are the metrics available for this monitor.
Metrics that are categorized as
[container/host](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/admin-guide/usage.html#about-custom-bundled-and-high-resolution-metrics)
(*default*) are ***in bold and italics*** in the list below.


 - `if_dropped.rx` (*cumulative*)<br>    Count of received packets dropped by the interface
 - `if_dropped.tx` (*cumulative*)<br>    Count of transmitted packets dropped by the interface
 - ***`if_errors.rx`*** (*cumulative*)<br>    Count of receive errors on the interface
 - ***`if_errors.tx`*** (*cumulative*)<br>    Count of transmit errors on the interface
 - ***`if_octets.rx`*** (*cumulative*)<br>    Count of bytes (octets) received on the interface
 - ***`if_octets.tx`*** (*cumulative*)<br>    Count of bytes (octets) transmitted by the interface
 - `if_packets.rx` (*cumulative*)<br>    Count of packets received on the interface
 - `if_packets.tx` (*cumulative*)<br>    Count of packets transmitted by the interface

### Non-default metrics (version 4.7.0+)

To emit metrics that are not _default_, you can add those metrics in the
generic monitor-level `extraMetrics` config option.  Metrics that are derived
from specific configuration options that do not appear in the above list of
metrics do not need to be added to `extraMetrics`.

To see a list of metrics that will be emitted you can run `agent-status
monitors` after configuring this monitor in a running agent instance.
