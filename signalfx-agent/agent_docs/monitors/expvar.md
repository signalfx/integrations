# expvar

Monitor Type: `expvar` ([Source](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/internal/monitors/expvar))

**Accepts Endpoints**: **Yes**

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: Yes

## Overview

The expvar monitor is a SignalFx Smart Agent monitor that scrapes metrics from variables exposed in JSON
format at an HTTP endpoint by [expvar](https://golang.org/pkg/expvar/). The monitor uses configured paths
to get metric and dimension values from fetched JSON objects.

The Metrics section in this document shows metrics derived from expvar variable
[memstats](https://golang.org/pkg/runtime/). The memstat variable is exposed by default. These memstat
metrics are referred to as standard or default metrics. The configuration examples shown are excerpts
limited to the monitor configuration section of the SignalFx Smart Agent configuration file `agent.yml`.

Below is an example showing the minimal required expvar monitor configuration for exporting
the default metrics from endpoint `http://172.17.0.3:8000/debug/vars`. `/debug/vars` is the default path.
```
monitors:
- type: expvar
  host: 172.17.0.3
  path: /debug/vars
  port: 8000
```
We recommend you include the extra dimension `metric_source` with a meaningful value in order to facilitate
filtering in the SignalFx app. See below.
```
monitors:
- type: expvar
  host: 172.17.0.3
  path: /debug/vars
  port: 8000
  extraDimensions:
    metric_source: expvar
```
Below is an example showing part of a JSON payload containing the exposed variable requestsPerSecond containing
requests per second metric information.
```
{
  ...
  "requestsPerSecond": 919,
  ...
}
```
Suppose that the payload is emanating from endpoint `http://172.17.0.4:6000/appmetrics`. The monitor can be
configured as shown below in order to scrape requestsPerSecond. The metric name is optional. If not provided,
the JSONPath value `requestsPerSecond` snake cased to `requests_per_second` will be used instead.
```
monitors:
- type: expvar
  host: 172.17.0.4
  path: /debug/vars
  port: 6000
  metrics:
    - name: requests.sec
      JSONPath: requestsPerSecond
      type: gauge
  extraDimensions:
    metric_source: expvar-aws
```
The expvar monitor can be configured to extract metric values from complex JSON objects such as the one shown
below. Suppose the `memstats` variable shown below is exposed at endpoint `http://172.17.0.5:5000/debug/vars`
and you want to extract the cumulative `Mallocs` values.
```
{
  ...
  "memstats": {
                ...
                "GCCPUFraction": 0.0000032707490586459204,
                "BySize": [
                  {
                      "Size": 32,
                      "Mallocs": 35387,
                      "Frees": 35021
                  },
                  {
                      "Size": 48,
                      "Mallocs": 35387,
                      "Frees": 63283
                  }
                ]
                "HeapAlloc": 2138088,
                ...
              }
  ...
}
```
The should be configured as shown below so as to fetch the `Mallocs` values. The JSONPath is what maps the
location of values with the JSON object. The path must terminate primitive values or an array containing
primitive values. It cannot terminated on embedded object(s).
```
monitors:
- type: expvar
  host: 172.12.0.5
  path: /debug/vars
  port: 5000
  metrics:
    - JSONPath: memstats.BySize.Mallocs
      type: cumulative
  extraDimensions:
    metric_source: expvar
```
No metric name was provided for this configuration so the metric name defaults to memstats.by_size.mallocs.
Because memstats.BySize is an array of size 2 there are 2 values for memstats.BySize.Mallocs (35387 and 35387).
Two data points are created for metric memstats.by_size.mallocs for the 2 values. Additionaly, a dimension
name memstats.by_size containing array index created for each respective datapoint.

Also, custom dimensions can be added to metric as shown below. The dimension name required if a dimension
value is provided whereas it is optional when a JSONPath is provided instead.
```
monitors:
- type: expvar
  host: 172.12.0.5
  path: /debug/vars
  port: 5000
  metrics:
    - JSONPath: memstats.BySize.Mallocs
      type: cumulative
      - dimensions:
        name: physical_memory
        value: 4GiB
      - name: app_mem
        value: "10 MiB"
  extraDimensions:
    metric_source: expvar
```
A dimension JSONPath is configured as shown below. The monitor gets JSON key at the specified path as the
dimension value. The dimension name is optional if the dimension JSONPath is specified. When not provided
the monitor snake cases the dimension JSONPath and uses that for the dimension name. The dimension JSONPath
must be shorter than the metric JSONPath and have the same root.
```
monitors:
- type: expvar
  host: 172.12.0.5
  path: /debug/vars
  port: 5000
  metrics:
    - JSONPath: memstats.BySize.Mallocs
      type: cumulative
      - dimensions:
        JSONPath: memstats
      - dimensions:
        name: by_size_index
        JSONPath: memstats.BySize
  extraDimensions:
    metric_source: expvar
```
DO NOT configure the monitor for memstats metrics because they are standard metrics provided by default.
memstats was used to provide a realistic example.


## Configuration

### Non-default metrics (version 4.7.0+)

**The following information applies to the agent version 4.7.0+ that has
`enableBuiltInFiltering: true` set on the top level of the agent config.**

To emit metrics that are not _default_, you can add those metrics in the
generic monitor-level `extraMetrics` config option.  Metrics that are derived
from specific configuration options that do not appear in the above list of
metrics do not need to be added to `extraMetrics`.

To see a list of metrics that will be emitted you can run `agent-status
monitors` after configuring this monitor in a running agent instance.

### Legacy non-default metrics (version < 4.7.0)

**The following information only applies to agent version older than 4.7.0. If
you have a newer agent and have set `enableBuiltInFiltering: true` at the top
level of your agent config, see the section above. See upgrade instructions in
[Old-style whitelist filtering](../legacy-filtering.html#old-style-whitelist-filtering).**

If you have a reference to the `whitelist.json` in your agent's top-level
`metricsToExclude` config option, and you want to emit metrics that are not in
that whitelist, then you need to add an item to the top-level
`metricsToInclude` config option to override that whitelist (see [Inclusion
filtering](../legacy-filtering.html#inclusion-filtering).  Or you can just
copy the whitelist.json, modify it, and reference that in `metricsToExclude`.
