# expvar

Monitor Type: `expvar` ([Source](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/main/pkg/monitors/expvar))

**Accepts Endpoints**: **Yes**

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: Yes

## Overview

The expvar monitor is a SignalFx Smart Agent monitor that scrapes metrics from variables exposed in JSON
format at an HTTP endpoint by [expvar](https://golang.org/pkg/expvar/). The monitor uses configured paths
to get metric and dimension values from fetched JSON objects.

The Metrics section in this document shows metrics derived from expvar variable
[memstats](https://golang.org/pkg/runtime/). The memstat variable is exposed by default. These memstat
metrics are referred to as standard or default metrics. The configuration examples shown are excerpts
limited to the monitor configuration section of the SignalFx Smart Agent configuration file `agent.yml`.

Below is an example showing the minimal required expvar monitor configuration for exporting
the default metrics from endpoint `http://172.17.0.3:8000/debug/vars`. `/debug/vars` is the default path.
```
monitors:
- type: expvar
  host: 172.17.0.3
  path: /debug/vars
  port: 8000
```
We recommend you include the extra dimension `metric_source` with a meaningful value in order to facilitate
filtering in the SignalFx app. See below.
```
monitors:
- type: expvar
  host: 172.17.0.3
  path: /debug/vars
  port: 8000
  extraDimensions:
    metric_source: expvar
```
Below is an example showing part of a JSON payload containing the exposed variable `requestsPerSecond` containing
requests per second metric information.
```
{
  ...
  "requestsPerSecond": 919,
  ...
}
```
Suppose that the payload is emanating from endpoint `http://172.17.0.4:6000/appmetrics`. The monitor can be
configured as shown below in order to scrape `requestsPerSecond`. The metric name is optional. If not provided,
the JSONPath value `requestsPerSecond` snake cased to `requests_per_second` will be used instead.
```
monitors:
- type: expvar
  host: 172.17.0.4
  path: /debug/vars
  port: 6000
  metrics:
    - name: requests.sec
      JSONPath: requestsPerSecond
      type: gauge
  extraDimensions:
    metric_source: expvar-aws
```
The expvar monitor can be configured to extract metric values from complex JSON objects such as the one shown
below. Suppose the `memstats` variable shown below is exposed at endpoint `http://172.17.0.5:5000/debug/vars`
and you want to extract the cumulative `Mallocs` values.
```
{
  ...
  "memstats": {
                ...
                "GCCPUFraction": 0.0000032707490586459204,
                "BySize": [
                  {
                      "Size": 32,
                      "Mallocs": 35387,
                      "Frees": 35021
                  },
                  {
                      "Size": 48,
                      "Mallocs": 35387,
                      "Frees": 63283
                  }
                ]
                "HeapAlloc": 2138088,
                ...
              }
  ...
}
```
To fetch the first cumulative `Mallocs` value in the `BySize` array configure the monitor as shown below. The
configured path (JSONPath) contains character delimited keys of metric values in the JSON object. The path must
be defined fully, terminating on primitive values or array of primitive values. The path should not terminated
on embedded object(s). No metric name was provided for this configuration so the metric name defaults to
`memstats.by_size.mallocs`. Also, a dimension named `memstats_by_size_index` containing the array index 0 is
created.
```
monitors:
- type: expvar
  host: 172.12.0.5
  path: /debug/vars
  port: 5000
  metrics:
    - JSONPath: memstats.BySize.0.Mallocs
      type: cumulative
  extraDimensions:
    metric_source: expvar
```
`.` is the default path separator character and thus no need to specify. Below is the same configuration using
 `/` as the path separator character.
```
monitors:
- type: expvar
  host: 172.12.0.5
  path: /debug/vars
  port: 5000
  metrics:
    - JSONPath: memstats/BySize/0/Mallocs
      pathSeparator: /
      type: cumulative
  extraDimensions:
    metric_source: expvar
```
To fetch all `Mallocs` values or a combination thereof, configure JSONPath with regular expression. The
configuration below configures the monitor to fetch all 2 `Mallocs` values (35387 and 35387). Two data points
for metric `memstats.by_size.mallocs` containing the values will be fetched. The datapoints will have dimension
`memstats_by_size_index` containing their respective array index. Note that the escape character `\` is used to
escape character `.` of regex `.*` in order take `.` literally as opposed to a path separator character.
```
monitors:
- type: expvar
  host: 172.12.0.5
  path: /debug/vars
  port: 5000
  metrics:
    - JSONPath: memstats.BySize.\\.*.Mallocs
      type: cumulative
  extraDimensions:
    metric_source: expvar
```
The configuration below will fetch all the `BySize` values.
```
monitors:
- type: expvar
  host: 172.12.0.5
  path: /debug/vars
  port: 5000
  metrics:
    - JSONPath: memstats.BySize.\\.*.\\.*
      type: cumulative
  extraDimensions:
    metric_source: expvar
```
The configuration below will also fetch all the `BySize` values.
```
monitors:
- type: expvar
  host: 172.12.0.5
  path: /debug/vars
  port: 5000
  metrics:
    - JSONPath: memstats.BySize.\\d+.\\.*
      type: cumulative
  extraDimensions:
    metric_source: expvar
```
Custom dimensions can be added to metrics as shown below. The dimension name is required if a dimension
value is provided. The dimension name is optional when JSONPath for the dimension is provided.
```
monitors:
- type: expvar
  host: 172.12.0.5
  path: /debug/vars
  port: 5000
  metrics:
    - JSONPath: memstats.BySize.\\.*.Mallocs
      type: cumulative
      - dimensions:
        name: physical_memory
        value: 4GiB
      - name: app_mem
        value: "10 MiB"
  extraDimensions:
    metric_source: expvar
```
The dimension JSONPathcan be configured as shown below. If the dimension name is not provided the dimension
name is constructed from snake casing the JSONPath. The dimension JSONPath must be shorter than the metric JSONPath
and start at same root. So, for the configuration below, dimensions `memory_stats` and `memstats_by_size` will
contain values `BySize` and `0` respectively.
```
monitors:
- type: expvar
  host: 172.12.0.5
  path: /debug/vars
  port: 5000
  metrics:
    - JSONPath: memstats.BySize.0.Mallocs
      type: cumulative
      - dimensions:
        name: memory_stats
        JSONPath: memstats
      - dimensions:
        JSONPath: memstats/BySize
  extraDimensions:
    metric_source: expvar
```
 DO NOT
configure the monitor for memstats metrics because they are standard metrics provided by default. We use memstats
here to provide a realistic example.


## Configuration

To activate this monitor in the Smart Agent, add the following to your
agent config:

```

### Non-default metrics (version 4.7.0+)

To emit metrics that are not _default_, you can add those metrics in the
generic monitor-level `extraMetrics` config option.  Metrics that are derived
from specific configuration options that do not appear in the above list of
metrics do not need to be added to `extraMetrics`.

To see a list of metrics that will be emitted you can run `agent-status
monitors` after configuring this monitor in a running agent instance.
