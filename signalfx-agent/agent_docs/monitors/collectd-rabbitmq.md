# collectd/rabbitmq

Monitor Type: `collectd/rabbitmq` ([Source](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/pkg/monitors/collectd/rabbitmq))

**Accepts Endpoints**: **Yes**

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: Yes

## Overview

Monitors an instance of RabbitMQ using the [collectd RabbitMQ Python
Plugin](https://github.com/signalfx/collectd-rabbitmq). This monitor uses
the [RabbitMQ Management HTTP
API](https://www.rabbitmq.com/management.html) to poll for statistics on a
RabbitMQ server, then reports them to the agent.  Works for RabbitMQ 3.0
and later.

**Note that you must individually enable each of the five `collect*`
options to get metrics pertaining to those facets of a RabbitMQ instance.
If none of them are enabled, no metrics will be sent.**


## Configuration

To activate this monitor in the Smart Agent, add the following to your
agent config:

```
monitors:  # All monitor config goes under this key
 - type: collectd/rabbitmq
   ...  # Additional config
```

**For a list of monitor options that are common to all monitors, see [Common

### Non-default metrics (version 4.7.0+)

To emit metrics that are not _default_, you can add those metrics in the
generic monitor-level `extraMetrics` config option.  Metrics that are derived
from specific configuration options that do not appear in the above list of
metrics do not need to be added to `extraMetrics`.

To see a list of metrics that will be emitted you can run `agent-status
monitors` after configuring this monitor in a running agent instance.
