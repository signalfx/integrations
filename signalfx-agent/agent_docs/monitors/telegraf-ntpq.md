# telegraf/ntpq

Monitor Type: `telegraf/ntpq` ([Source](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/main/pkg/monitors/telegraf/monitors/ntpq))

**Accepts Endpoints**: **Yes**

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: Yes

## Overview

This is an embedded form of the [Telegraf NTPQ
plugin](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/ntpq).

This montior requires the `ntpq` executable available on the PATH of the agent.


## Configuration

To activate this monitor in the Smart Agent, add the following to your
agent config:

```
monitors:  # All monitor config goes under this key
 - type: telegraf/ntpq
   ...  # Additional config
```

**For a list of monitor options that are common to all monitors, see [Common
Configuration](../monitor-config.html#common-configuration).**


| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `dnsLookup` | no | `bool` | If false, set the -n ntpq flag. Can reduce metric gather time. (**default:** `true`) |


## Metrics

These are the metrics available for this monitor.
Metrics that are categorized as
[container/host](https://docs.splunk.com/Observability/admin/subscription-usage/monitor-imm-billing-usage.html#about-custom-bundled-and-high-resolution-metrics)
(*default*) are ***in bold and italics*** in the list below.

This monitor will also emit by default any metrics that are not listed below.


 - ***`ntpq.delay`*** (*gauge*)<br>
 - ***`ntpq.jitter`*** (*gauge*)<br>
 - ***`ntpq.offset`*** (*gauge*)<br>
 - ***`ntpq.poll`*** (*gauge*)<br>
 - ***`ntpq.reach`*** (*gauge*)<br>
 - ***`ntpq.when`*** (*gauge*)<br>

### Non-default metrics (version 4.7.0+)

To emit metrics that are not _default_, you can add those metrics in the
generic monitor-level `extraMetrics` config option.  Metrics that are derived
from specific configuration options that do not appear in the above list of
metrics do not need to be added to `extraMetrics`.

To see a list of metrics that will be emitted you can run `agent-status
monitors` after configuring this monitor in a running agent instance.
