# collectd/python

Monitor Type: `collectd/python` ([Source](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/main/pkg/monitors/collectd/python))

**Accepts Endpoints**: **Yes**

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: Yes

## Overview

This monitor runs arbitrary collectd Python
plugins directly, apart from collectd.  It implements a mock collectd Python
interface that supports most, but not all, of the real collectd.


## Configuration

To activate this monitor in the Smart Agent, add the following to your
agent config:

```
monitors:  # All monitor config goes under this key
 - type: collectd/python
   ...  # Additional config
```

**For a list of monitor options that are common to all monitors, see [Common
Configuration](../monitor-config.html#common-configuration).**


| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `pythonBinary` | no | `string` | Path to a python binary that should be used to execute the Python code. If not set, a built-in runtime will be used.  Can include arguments to the binary as well. |
| `host` | no | `string` | Host will be filled in by auto-discovery if this monitor has a discovery rule.  It can then be used under pluginConfig by the template `{{.Host}}` |
| `port` | no | `integer` | Port will be filled in by auto-discovery if this monitor has a discovery rule.  It can then be used under pluginConfig by the template `{{.Port}}` (**default:** `0`) |
| `moduleName` | no | `string` | Corresponds to the ModuleName option in collectd-python |
| `modulePaths` | no | `list of strings` | Corresponds to a set of ModulePath options in collectd-python |
| `pluginConfig` | no | `map of any` | This is a yaml form of the collectd config. |
| `typesDBPaths` | no | `list of strings` | A set of paths to [../types.db files](https://collectd.org/documentation/manpages/types.db.5.shtml) that are needed by your plugin.  If not specified, the runner will use the global collectd ../types.db file. |



The agent does not do any built-in filtering of metrics coming out of this
monitor.
