# windows-legacy

Monitor Type: `windows-legacy` ([Source](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/main/pkg/monitors/windowslegacy))

**Accepts Endpoints**: No

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: **No**

## Overview

(Windows Only) This monitor reports metrics for Windows system Performance Counters.
The metric names are intended to match what was originally reported by
the SignalFx [PerfCounterReporter](https://github.com/signalfx/PerfCounterReporter)
The metric types are all gauges as originally reported by the PerfCounterReporter.

## Windows Performance Counters
The underlying source for these metrics are Windows Performance Counters.
Most of the performance counters that we query in this monitor are actually
rates per second and percentages that we report as instantaneous Gauge values
each collection interval.

Sample YAML configuration:

```yaml
monitors:
 - type: windows-legacy
```


## Configuration

To activate this monitor in the Smart Agent, add the following to your
agent config:

```
monitors:  # All monitor config goes under this key
 - type: windows-legacy
   ...  # Additional config
```

**For a list of monitor options that are common to all monitors, see [Common
Configuration](../monitor-config.html#common-configuration).**


| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `counterRefreshInterval` | no | `int64` | (Windows Only) Number of seconds that wildcards in counter paths should be expanded and how often to refresh counters from configuration. (**default:** `60s`) |
| `printValid` | no | `bool` | (Windows Only) Print out the configurations that match available performance counters.  This used for debugging. (**default:** `false`) |


## Metrics

These are the metrics available for this monitor.
Metrics that are categorized as
[container/host](https://docs.splunk.com/observability/admin/subscription-usage/monitor-imm-billing-usage.html#about-custom-bundled-and-high-resolution-metrics)
(*default*) are ***in bold and italics*** in the list below.


 - `logicaldisk.disk_read_bytes_sec` (*gauge*)<br>    The number of bytes read from disk per second.
 - ***`logicaldisk.disk_reads_sec`*** (*gauge*)<br>    The number of read operations per second.
 - `logicaldisk.disk_transfers_sec` (*gauge*)<br>    The number of transfers per second.
 - `logicaldisk.disk_write_bytes_sec` (*gauge*)<br>    The number of bytes written to disk per second.
 - ***`logicaldisk.disk_writes_sec`*** (*gauge*)<br>    The number of write operations per second.
 - ***`logicaldisk.free_megabytes`*** (*gauge*)<br>    The number of available megabytes.
 - ***`logicaldisk.pct_free_space`*** (*gauge*)<br>    The percentage of free disk space available.
 - ***`memory.available_mbytes`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Unused physical memory (not page file).
 - ***`memory.pages_input_sec`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Reads from hard disk per second to resolve hard pages.
 - ***`network_interface.bytes_received_sec`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Bytes Received/sec is the rate at which bytes are received over each network adapter, including framing characters.
 - ***`network_interface.bytes_sent_sec`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Bytes Sent/sec is the rate at which bytes are sent over each network adapter, including framing characters.
 - ***`network_interface.bytes_total_sec`*** (*gauge*)<br>    The number of bytes sent and received over a specific network adapter, including framing characters.
 - `network_interface.current_bandwidth` (*gauge*)<br>    Current Bandwidth is an estimate of the current bandwidth of the network interface in bits per second (BPS).
 - `network_interface.packets_outbound_discarded` (*gauge*)<br>    The number of outbound packets discarded
 - ***`network_interface.packets_outbound_errors`*** (*gauge*)<br>    The number of packets sent that encountered an error.
 - `network_interface.packets_received_discarded` (*gauge*)<br>    The number of received packets discarded.
 - ***`network_interface.packets_received_errors`*** (*gauge*)<br>    The number of packets received that encountered an error.
 - `network_interface.packets_received_sec` (*gauge*)<br>    Tracking the packets received over time can give you a good indication of the typical use of the system's network.
 - `network_interface.packets_sent_sec` (*gauge*)<br>    The number of packets sent per second.
 - ***`paging_file.pct_usage`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Amount of Page File in use, which indicates the server is substituting disk space for memory.
 - `paging_file.pct_usage_peak` (*gauge*)<br>    Highest %Usage metric since the last time the server was restarted.
 - `physicaldisk.avg_disk_sec_read` (*gauge*)<br>    The average time, in milliseconds, of each read from disk.
 - `physicaldisk.avg_disk_sec_transfer` (*gauge*)<br>    The average time in milliseconds spent transfering data on disk.
 - `physicaldisk.avg_disk_sec_write` (*gauge*)<br>    The average time, in milliseconds, of each write to disk.
 - `processor.interrupts_sec` (*gauge*)<br>    Rate of processor interrupts per second.
 - `processor.pct_privileged_time` (*gauge*)<br>    Percentage of elapsed time the processor spends on privileged tasks.
 - ***`processor.pct_processor_time`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Percentage of elapsed time the processor spends executing non-idle threads.
 - `processor.pct_user_time` (*gauge*)<br>    Percentage of elapsed time the processor spends executing user threads.
 - `system.context_switches_sec` (*gauge*)<br>    Number of execution contexts switched in the last second, where >6000 is poor, <3000 is good, and <1500 is excellent.
 - `system.processor_queue_length` (*gauge*)<br>    Number of threads waiting for CPU cycles, where < 12 per CPU is good/fair, < 8 is better, < 4 is best
 - `system.system_calls_sec` (*gauge*)<br>    The number of system calls being serviced by the CPU per second.

### Non-default metrics (version 4.7.0+)

To emit metrics that are not _default_, you can add those metrics in the
generic monitor-level `extraMetrics` config option.  Metrics that are derived
from specific configuration options that do not appear in the above list of
metrics do not need to be added to `extraMetrics`.

To see a list of metrics that will be emitted you can run `agent-status
monitors` after configuring this monitor in a running agent instance.
