## Overview

Gathers metrics about the network protocol

plugin](https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:Protocols).


## Configuration

agent config:

```
monitors:  # All monitor config goes under this key
 - type: collectd/protocols
   ...  # Additional config
```

**For a list of monitor options that are common to all monitors, see [Common
Configuration](../monitor-config.html#common-configuration).**


This monitor has no configuration options.
## Metrics

These are the metrics available for this monitor.
Metrics that are categorized as
[container/host](https://docs.splunk.com/observability/admin/subscription-usage/monitor-imm-billing-usage.html#about-custom-bundled-and-high-resolution-metrics)
(*default*) are ***in bold and italics*** in the list below.


 - ***`protocol_counter.ActiveOpens`*** (*cumulative*)<br>    The number of times TCP connections transitioned from the CLOSED state to the SYN-SENT state.
 - `protocol_counter.CurrEstab` (*cumulative*)<br>    The number of TCP connections currently in either ESTABLISHED or CLOSE-WAIT state.
 - `protocol_counter.DelayedACKs` (*cumulative*)<br>    The number of acknowledgements delayed by TCP Delayed Acknowledgement
 - `protocol_counter.InDestUnreachs` (*cumulative*)<br>    The number of ICMP Destination Unreachable messages received
 - `protocol_counter.OutSegs` (*cumulative*)<br>    The total number of segments that have been sent, including those on current connections but excluding those containing only retransmitted octets.

 - `protocol_counter.PassiveOpens` (*cumulative*)<br>    The number of times that a server opened a connection, due to receiving a TCP SYN packet.
 - `protocol_counter.RetransSegs` (*cumulative*)<br>    The total number of segments retransmitted

### Non-default metrics (version 4.7.0+)

To emit metrics that are not _default_, you can add those metrics in the
generic monitor-level `extraMetrics` config option.  Metrics that are derived
from specific configuration options that do not appear in the above list of
metrics do not need to be added to `extraMetrics`.

To see a list of metrics that will be emitted you can run `agent-status
monitors` after configuring this monitor in a running agent instance.
