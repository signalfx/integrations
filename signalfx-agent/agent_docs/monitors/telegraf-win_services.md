## Metrics

These are the metrics available for this monitor.
This monitor emits all metrics by default; however, **none are categorized as
[container/host](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/admin-guide/usage.html#about-custom-bundled-and-high-resolution-metrics)
-- they are all custom**.



 - ***`win_services.startup_mode`*** (*gauge*)<br>    The configured start up mode of the window windows service.  Possible values are: `0` (Boot Start), `1` (System Start), `2` (Auto Start), `3` (Demand Start), `4` (disabled).
 - ***`win_services.state`*** (*gauge*)<br>    The state of the windows service.  Possible values are: `1` (Stopped), `2` (Start Pending), `3` (Stop Pending), `4` (Running), `5` (Continue Pending), `6` (Pause Pending), and `7` (Paused).
The agent does not do any built-in filtering of metrics coming out of this
monitor.
