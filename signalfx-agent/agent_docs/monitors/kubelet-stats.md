# kubelet-stats

Monitor Type: `kubelet-stats` ([Source](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/internal/monitors/cadvisor))

**Accepts Endpoints**: No

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: Yes

## Overview

This monitor pulls cadvisor metrics through a
Kubernetes kubelet instance via the `/stats/container` endpoint.


## Configuration

To activate this monitor in the Smart Agent, add the following to your
agent config:

```
monitors:  # All monitor config goes under this key
 - type: kubelet-stats
   ...  # Additional config
```

**For a list of monitor options that are common to all monitors, see [Common
Configuration](../monitor-config.html#common-configuration).**


| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `kubeletAPI` | no | `object (see below)` | Kubelet client configuration |


The **nested** `kubeletAPI` config object has the following fields:

| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `url` | no | `string` | URL of the Kubelet instance.  This will default to `https://<current node hostname>:10250` if not provided. |
| `authType` | no | `string` | Can be `none` for no auth, `tls` for TLS client cert auth, or `serviceAccount` to use the pod's default service account token to authenticate. (**default:** `none`) |
| `skipVerify` | no | `bool` | Whether to skip verification of the Kubelet's TLS cert (**default:** `true`) |
| `caCertPath` | no | `string` | Path to the CA cert that has signed the Kubelet's TLS cert, unnecessary if `skipVerify` is set to false. |
| `clientCertPath` | no | `string` | Path to the client TLS cert to use if `authType` is set to `tls` |
| `clientKeyPath` | no | `string` | Path to the client TLS key to use if `authType` is set to `tls` |
| `logResponses` | no | `bool` | Whether to log the raw cadvisor response at the debug level for debugging purposes. (**default:** `false`) |


## Metrics

These are the metrics available for this monitor.
Metrics that are categorized as
[container/host](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/admin-guide/usage.html#about-custom-bundled-and-high-resolution-metrics)
(*default*) are ***in bold and italics*** in the list below.


 - `container_cpu_cfs_periods` (*cumulative*)<br>    Total number of elapsed CFS enforcement intervals
 - `container_cpu_cfs_throttled_periods` (*cumulative*)<br>    Total number of times tasks in the cgroup have been throttled
 - `container_cpu_cfs_throttled_time` (*cumulative*)<br>    Total time duration, in nanoseconds, for which tasks in the cgroup have been throttled
 - ***`container_cpu_percent`*** (*cumulative*)<br>    Cumulative cpu utilization as a percentage of the total host CPU available.  This metric is equivalent to `container_cpu_utilization` / <# of CPUs/cores on host>.

 - `container_cpu_usage_seconds_total` (*cumulative*)<br>    Cumulative cpu time consumed per cpu in nanoseconds
 - `container_cpu_user_seconds_total` (*cumulative*)<br>    Cumulative user cpu time consumed in nanoseconds
 - ***`container_cpu_utilization`*** (*cumulative*)<br>    Cumulative cpu utilization in percentages.  This is equivalent to "centicores", or hundreths of CPU cores consumed.  This metric is **NOT** normalized by the total # of cores on the system.
 - `container_cpu_utilization_per_core` (*cumulative*)<br>    Cumulative cpu utilization in percentages per core
 - `container_fs_io_current` (*gauge*)<br>    Number of I/Os currently in progress

 - ***`container_fs_reads_total`*** (*cumulative*)<br>    Cumulative count of reads completed
 - `container_fs_sector_reads_total` (*cumulative*)<br>    Cumulative count of sector reads completed
 - `container_fs_sector_writes_total` (*cumulative*)<br>    Cumulative count of sector writes completed
 - ***`container_fs_usage_bytes`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Number of bytes that are consumed by the container on this filesystem
 - ***`container_fs_write_seconds_total`*** (*cumulative*)<br>    Cumulative count of seconds spent writing
 - `container_fs_writes_merged_total` (*cumulative*)<br>    Cumulative count of writes merged
 - ***`container_fs_writes_total`*** (*cumulative*)<br>    Cumulative count of writes completed
 - `container_last_seen` (*gauge*)<br>    Last time a container was seen by the exporter
 - `container_memory_failcnt` (*cumulative*)<br>    Number of memory usage hits limits
 - ***`container_memory_failures_total`*** (*cumulative*)<br>    Cumulative count of memory allocation failures
 - ***`container_memory_usage_bytes`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Current memory usage in bytes
 - `container_memory_working_set_bytes` (*gauge*)<br>    Current working set in bytes
 - ***`container_spec_cpu_period`*** (*gauge*)<br>    The number of microseconds that the [CFS scheduler](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/scheduler/sched-bwc.txt) uses as a window when limiting container processes
 - ***`container_spec_cpu_quota`*** (*gauge*)<br>    In CPU quota for the CFS process scheduler. In K8s this is equal to the containers's CPU limit as a fraction of 1 core and multiplied by the `container_spec_cpu_period`.  So if the CPU limit is `500m` (500 millicores) for a container and the `container_spec_cpu_period` is set to 100,000, this value will be 50,000.
 - `container_spec_cpu_shares` (*gauge*)<br>    CPU share of the container
 - ***`container_spec_memory_limit_bytes`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Memory limit for the container.
 - `container_spec_memory_swap_limit_bytes` (*gauge*)<br>    Memory swap limit for the container.
 - `container_start_time_seconds` (*gauge*)<br>    Start time of the container since unix epoch in seconds.
 - `container_tasks_state` (*gauge*)<br>    Number of tasks in given state

 - `pod_network_transmit_packets_dropped_total` (*cumulative*)<br>    Cumulative count of packets dropped while transmitting
 - `pod_network_transmit_packets_total` (*cumulative*)<br>    Cumulative count of packets transmitted

### Non-default metrics (version 4.7.0+)

**The following information applies to the agent version 4.7.0+ that has
`enableBuiltInFiltering: true` set on the top level of the agent config.**

To emit metrics that are not _default_, you can add those metrics in the
generic monitor-level `extraMetrics` config option.  Metrics that are derived
from specific configuration options that do not appear in the above list of
metrics do not need to be added to `extraMetrics`.

To see a list of metrics that will be emitted you can run `agent-status
monitors` after configuring this monitor in a running agent instance.

### Legacy non-default metrics (version < 4.7.0)

**The following information only applies to agent version older than 4.7.0. If
you have a newer agent and have set `enableBuiltInFiltering: true` at the top
level of your agent config, see the section above. See upgrade instructions in
[Old-style whitelist filtering](../legacy-filtering.html#old-style-whitelist-filtering).**

If you have a reference to the `whitelist.json` in your agent's top-level
`metricsToExclude` config option, and you want to emit metrics that are not in
that whitelist, then you need to add an item to the top-level
`metricsToInclude` config option to override that whitelist (see [Inclusion
filtering](../legacy-filtering.html#inclusion-filtering).  Or you can just
copy the whitelist.json, modify it, and reference that in `metricsToExclude`.

## Dimensions

The following dimensions may occur on metrics emitted by this monitor.  Some
dimensions may be specific to certain metrics.

| Name | Description |
| ---  | ---         |
| `container_id` | The ID of the running container |
| `container_image` | The container image name |
| `container_name` | The container's name as it appears in the pod spec, the same as container_spec_name but retained for backwards compatibility. |
| `container_spec_name` | The container's name as it appears in the pod spec |
| `kubernetes_namespace` | The K8s namespace the container is part of |
| `kubernetes_pod_name` | The pod instance under which this container runs |
| `kubernetes_pod_uid` | The UID of the pod instance under which this container runs |
