# java-monitor

Monitor Type: `java-monitor` ([Source](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/pkg/monitors/subproc/signalfx/java))

**Accepts Endpoints**: **Yes**

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: Yes

## Overview

This monitor allows you to generate metrics from a Java application.


## Configuration

To activate this monitor in the Smart Agent, add the following to your
agent config:

```
monitors:  # All monitor config goes under this key
 - type: java-monitor
   ...  # Additional config
```

**For a list of monitor options that are common to all monitors, see [Common
Configuration](../monitor-config.html#common-configuration).**


| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `host` | no | `string` | Host will be filled in by auto-discovery if this monitor has a discovery rule. |
| `port` | no | `integer` | Port will be filled in by auto-discovery if this monitor has a discovery rule. (**default:** `0`) |
| `jarFilePath` | no | `string` | Path to the .jar file that implements the monitoring logic. |
| `javaBinary` | no | `string` | By default, the agent will use its bundled Java runtime (Java 8) If you wish to use a Java runtime that already exists on the system, specify the full path to the `java` binary here, e.g. `/usr/bin/java`. |
| `mainClass` | no | `string` | The class within the specified `jarFilePath` that contains a main method to execute. |
| `classPath` | no | `list of strings` | Additional class paths to set on the invoked Java subprocess. |
| `extraJavaArgs` | no | `list of strings` | Additional flags to the Java subprocess |



The agent does not do any built-in filtering of metrics coming out of this
monitor.
