# ecs-metadata

Monitor Type: `ecs-metadata` ([Source](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/internal/monitors/ecs))

**Accepts Endpoints**: No

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: Yes

## Overview

This monitor reads container stats from a
[ECS Task Metadata Endpoint version 2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-metadata-endpoint-v2.html).

This currently does not support CPU share/quota metrics.


## Configuration

To activate this monitor in the Smart Agent, add the following to your
agent config:

```
monitors:  # All monitor config goes under this key
 - type: ecs-metadata
   ...  # Additional config
```

**For a list of monitor options that are common to all monitors, see [Common
Configuration](../monitor-config.html#common-configuration).**


| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `enableExtraBlockIOMetrics` | no | `bool` | Whether it will send all extra block IO metrics as well. (**default:** `false`) |
| `enableExtraCPUMetrics` | no | `bool` | Whether it will send all extra CPU metrics as well. (**default:** `false`) |
| `enableExtraMemoryMetrics` | no | `bool` | Whether it will send all extra memory metrics as well. (**default:** `false`) |
| `enableExtraNetworkMetrics` | no | `bool` | Whether it will send all extra network metrics as well. (**default:** `false`) |
| `metadataEndpoint` | no | `string` | The URL of the ECS task metadata. Default is http://169.254.170.2/v2/metadata, which is hardcoded by AWS for version 2. (**default:** `http://169.254.170.2/v2/metadata`) |
| `statsEndpoint` | no | `string` | The URL of the ECS container stats. Default is http://169.254.170.2/v2/stats, which is hardcoded by AWS for version 2. (**default:** `http://169.254.170.2/v2/stats`) |
| `timeoutSeconds` | no | `integer` | The maximum amount of time to wait for API requests (**default:** `5`) |
| `labelsToDimensions` | no | `map of strings` | A mapping of container label names to dimension names. The corresponding label values will become the dimension value for the mapped name.  E.g. `io.kubernetes.container.name: container_spec_name` would result in a dimension called `container_spec_name` that has the value of the `io.kubernetes.container.name` container label. |
| `excludedImages` | no | `list of strings` | A list of filters of images to exclude.  Supports literals, globs, and regex. |

#### Group cpu
All of the following metrics are part of the `cpu` metric group. All of
the non-default metrics below can be turned on by adding `cpu` to the
monitor config option `extraGroups`:

 - ***`memory.usage.total`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Bytes of memory used by the container

#### Group network
All of the following metrics are part of the `network` metric group. All of

### Non-default metrics (version 4.7.0+)

**The following information applies to the agent version 4.7.0+ that has
`enableBuiltInFiltering: true` set on the top level of the agent config.**

To emit metrics that are not _default_, you can add those metrics in the
generic monitor-level `extraMetrics` config option.  Metrics that are derived
from specific configuration options that do not appear in the above list of
metrics do not need to be added to `extraMetrics`.

To see a list of metrics that will be emitted you can run `agent-status
monitors` after configuring this monitor in a running agent instance.

### Legacy non-default metrics (version < 4.7.0)

**The following information only applies to agent version older than 4.7.0. If
you have a newer agent and have set `enableBuiltInFiltering: true` at the top
level of your agent config, see the section above. See upgrade instructions in
[Old-style whitelist filtering](../legacy-filtering.html#old-style-whitelist-filtering).**

If you have a reference to the `whitelist.json` in your agent's top-level
`metricsToExclude` config option, and you want to emit metrics that are not in
that whitelist, then you need to add an item to the top-level
`metricsToInclude` config option to override that whitelist (see [Inclusion
filtering](../legacy-filtering.html#inclusion-filtering).  Or you can just
copy the whitelist.json, modify it, and reference that in `metricsToExclude`.
