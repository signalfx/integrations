# ecs-metadata

Monitor Type: `ecs-metadata` ([Source](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/main/pkg/monitors/ecs))

**Accepts Endpoints**: No

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: Yes

## Overview

This monitor reads container stats from a
[ECS Task Metadata Endpoint version 2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-metadata-endpoint-v2.html).

This currently does not support CPU share/quota metrics.


## Configuration

To activate this monitor in the Smart Agent, add the following to your
agent config:

```
monitors:  # All monitor config goes under this key
 - type: ecs-metadata
   ...  # Additional config
```

**For a list of monitor options that are common to all monitors, see [Common
Configuration](../monitor-config.html#common-configuration).**


| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `enableExtraBlockIOMetrics` | no | `bool` | Whether it will send all extra block IO metrics as well. (**default:** `false`) |
| `enableExtraCPUMetrics` | no | `bool` | Whether it will send all extra CPU metrics as well. (**default:** `false`) |
| `enableExtraMemoryMetrics` | no | `bool` | Whether it will send all extra memory metrics as well. (**default:** `false`) |
| `enableExtraNetworkMetrics` | no | `bool` | Whether it will send all extra network metrics as well. (**default:** `false`) |
| `metadataEndpoint` | no | `string` | The URL of the ECS task metadata. Default is http://169.254.170.2/v2/metadata, which is hardcoded by AWS for version 2. (**default:** `http://169.254.170.2/v2/metadata`) |
| `statsEndpoint` | no | `string` | The URL of the ECS container stats. Default is http://169.254.170.2/v2/stats, which is hardcoded by AWS for version 2. (**default:** `http://169.254.170.2/v2/stats`) |
| `timeoutSeconds` | no | `integer` | The maximum amount of time to wait for API requests (**default:** `5`) |
| `labelsToDimensions` | no | `map of strings` | A mapping of container label names to dimension names. The corresponding label values will become the dimension value for the mapped name.  E.g. `io.kubernetes.container.name: container_spec_name` would result in a dimension called `container_spec_name` that has the value of the `io.kubernetes.container.name` container label. |
| `excludedImages` | no | `list of strings` | A list of filters of images to exclude.  Supports literals, globs, and regex. |


## Metrics

These are the metrics available for this monitor.
Metrics that are categorized as
[container/host](https://docs.splunk.com/observability/admin/subscription-usage/monitor-imm-billing-usage.html#about-custom-bundled-and-high-resolution-metrics)
(*default*) are ***in bold and italics*** in the list below.


#### Group blkio
All of the following metrics are part of the `blkio` metric group. All of
the non-default metrics below can be turned on by adding `blkio` to the
monitor config option `extraGroups`:
 - `blkio.io_service_bytes_recursive.async` (*cumulative*)<br>    Volume, in bytes, of asynchronous block I/O
 - ***`blkio.io_service_bytes_recursive.read`*** (*cumulative*)<br>    Volume, in bytes, of reads from block devices
 - `blkio.io_service_bytes_recursive.sync` (*cumulative*)<br>    Volume, in bytes, of synchronous block I/O
 - `blkio.io_service_bytes_recursive.total` (*cumulative*)<br>    Total volume, in bytes, of all block I/O
 - ***`blkio.io_service_bytes_recursive.write`*** (*cumulative*)<br>    Volume, in bytes, of writes to block devices
 - `blkio.io_serviced_recursive.async` (*cumulative*)<br>    Number of asynchronous block I/O requests
 - `blkio.io_serviced_recursive.read` (*cumulative*)<br>    Number of reads requests from block devices
 - `blkio.io_serviced_recursive.sync` (*cumulative*)<br>    Number of synchronous block I/O requests
 - `blkio.io_serviced_recursive.total` (*cumulative*)<br>    Total number of block I/O requests
 - `blkio.io_serviced_recursive.write` (*cumulative*)<br>    Number of write requests to block devices

#### Group cpu
All of the following metrics are part of the `cpu` metric group. All of
the non-default metrics below can be turned on by adding `cpu` to the
monitor config option `extraGroups`:
 - `cpu.limit` (*gauge*)<br>    CPU usage limit of the container, in ECS vCPU units
 - `cpu.percent` (*gauge*)<br>    Percentage of host CPU resources used by the container
 - `cpu.percpu.usage` (*cumulative*)<br>    Jiffies of CPU time spent by the container, per CPU core
 - `cpu.throttling_data.periods` (*cumulative*)<br>    Number of periods
 - `cpu.throttling_data.throttled_periods` (*cumulative*)<br>    Number of periods throttled
 - `cpu.throttling_data.throttled_time` (*cumulative*)<br>    Throttling time in nano seconds
 - `cpu.usage.kernelmode` (*cumulative*)<br>    Jiffies of CPU time spent in kernel mode by the container
 - ***`cpu.usage.system`*** (*cumulative*)<br>    Jiffies of CPU time used by the system
 - ***`cpu.usage.total`*** (*cumulative*)<br>    Jiffies of CPU time used by the container
 - `cpu.usage.usermode` (*cumulative*)<br>    Jiffies of CPU time spent in user mode by the container

#### Group memory
All of the following metrics are part of the `memory` metric group. All of
the non-default metrics below can be turned on by adding `memory` to the
monitor config option `extraGroups`:
 - `memory.percent` (*gauge*)<br>    Percent of memory (0-100) used by the container relative to its limit (excludes page cache usage)
 - `memory.stats.swap` (*gauge*)<br>    Bytes of swap memory used by container
 - ***`memory.usage.limit`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Memory usage limit of the container, in bytes
 - `memory.usage.max` (*gauge*)<br>    Maximum measured memory usage of the container, in bytes
 - ***`memory.usage.total`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Bytes of memory used by the container

#### Group network
All of the following metrics are part of the `network` metric group. All of
the non-default metrics below can be turned on by adding `network` to the
monitor config option `extraGroups`:

 - `network.usage.tx_dropped` (*cumulative*)<br>    Number of outbound network packets dropped by the container
 - `network.usage.tx_errors` (*cumulative*)<br>    Errors sending network packets
 - `network.usage.tx_packets` (*cumulative*)<br>    Network packets sent by the container via its network interface

### Non-default metrics (version 4.7.0+)

To emit metrics that are not _default_, you can add those metrics in the
generic monitor-level `extraMetrics` config option.  Metrics that are derived
from specific configuration options that do not appear in the above list of
metrics do not need to be added to `extraMetrics`.

To see a list of metrics that will be emitted you can run `agent-status
monitors` after configuring this monitor in a running agent instance.
