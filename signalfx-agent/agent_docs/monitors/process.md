# process

Monitor Type: `process` ([Source](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/main/pkg/monitors/process))

**Accepts Endpoints**: No

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: **No**

## Overview


## Configuration

To activate this monitor in the Smart Agent, add the following to your
agent config:

```
monitors:  # All monitor config goes under this key
 - type: process
   ...  # Additional config
```

**For a list of monitor options that are common to all monitors, see [Common
Configuration](../monitor-config.html#common-configuration).**


| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `processes` | no | `list of strings` | A list of process command names to match and send metrics about.  This is the name contained in /proc/<pid>/comm and is limited to just 15 characters on Linux.  Only one of `processes` or `executables` must match a process for it to have metrics generated about it. This is an [overridable set](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/integrations/agent/filtering.html#overridable-filters) that supports regexp and glob values. |
| `executables` | no | `list of strings` | A list of process executable paths to match against and send metrics about.  This is the binary executable that is symlinked in the /proc/<pid>/exe file on Linux.  This must match the full path.  Only one of `processes` or `executables` must match a process for it to have metrics generated about it. This is an [overridable set](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/integrations/agent/filtering.html#overridable-filters) that supports regexp and glob values. |


## Metrics

These are the metrics available for this monitor.
Metrics that are categorized as
[container/host](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/admin-guide/usage.html#about-custom-bundled-and-high-resolution-metrics)
(*default*) are ***in bold and italics*** in the list below.


 - ***`process.cpu_time_seconds`*** (*cumulative*)<br>    Total CPU usage of the process in seconds.  If you analyze this metric as a rate/second, it tells you how many CPU cores the process is using.
 - ***`process.rss_memory_bytes`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Current RSS Memory usage of the process, in bytes

### Non-default metrics (version 4.7.0+)

To emit metrics that are not _default_, you can add those metrics in the
generic monitor-level `extraMetrics` config option.  Metrics that are derived
from specific configuration options that do not appear in the above list of
metrics do not need to be added to `extraMetrics`.

To see a list of metrics that will be emitted you can run `agent-status
monitors` after configuring this monitor in a running agent instance.
