# elasticsearch

Monitor Type: `elasticsearch` ([Source](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/pkg/monitors/elasticsearch/stats))

**Accepts Endpoints**: **Yes**

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: Yes

## Overview

This monitor collects stats from Elasticsearch. It collects node, cluster
and index level stats. This monitor is compatible with the current collectd
plugin found [here] (https://github.com/signalfx/collectd-elasticsearch) in
terms of metric naming.

This monitor collects cluster level and index level stats only from the current master
in an Elasticsearch cluster by default. It is possible to override this with the
`clusterHealthStatsMasterOnly` and `indexStatsMasterOnly` config options respectively.

A simple configuration that collects only default (non-custom) metrics
looks like the following:

```yaml
monitors:
- type: elasticsearch
  host: localhost
  port: 9200
```

## Enhanced (custom) metrics

The monitor collects a subset of node stats of JVM, process, HTTP,
transport, indices and thread pool stats. It is possible to enable
enhanced stats for each stat group separately.  Note that these metrics
get categorized under the _custom_ group if you are on host-based
pricing. Here's an example:

```yaml
monitors:
- type: elasticsearch
  host: localhost
  port: 9200
  enableEnhancedHTTPStats: true
  enableEnhancedJVMStats: true
  enableEnhancedProcessStats: true
  enableEnhancedThreadPoolStats: true
  enableEnhancedTransportStats: true
  enableEnhancedNodeIndicesStats:
   - indexing
   - warmer
   - get

```

The `enableEnhancedNodeIndicesStats` option takes a list of index stats groups
for which enhanced stats will be collected. A comprehensive list of all
such available groups can be found [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/cluster-nodes-stats.html#node-indices-stats).

Note that the `enableEnhancedIndexStatsForIndexGroups` is similar to
`enableEnhancedNodeIndicesStats`, but for index level stats.

## Thread Pools

By default thread pool stats from the "search" and "index" thread pools are collected. To collect
stats from other thread pools specify the `threadPools` config option:

```yaml
monitors:
- type: elasticsearch
  host: localhost
  port: 9200
  threadPools:
  - bulk
  - warmer
  - listener
```

Here is a list of valid thread pools by Elasticsearch version:

| thread pool name | ES 1.x | ES 2.0 | ES 2.1+ |
|------------------|--------|--------|--------|
| merge            | &#x2713;      |        |        |
| optimize         |&#x2713;     |        |        |
| bulk             |&#x2713;     |&#x2713;     |&#x2713;     |
| flush            |&#x2713;     |&#x2713;     |&#x2713;     |
| generic          |&#x2713;     |&#x2713;     |&#x2713;     |
| get              |&#x2713;     |&#x2713;     |&#x2713;     |

| listener         |        |&#x2713;     |&#x2713;     |
| management       |        |&#x2713;     |&#x2713;     |
| percolate        |        |&#x2713;     |&#x2713;     |
| suggest          |        |&#x2713;     |&#x2713;     |
| force\_merge      |        |        |&#x2713;     |


## Collecting index statistics

By default, the configuration parameter `indexes` is empty, which means
collect stats on all indexes. To collect statistics from a subset of
indexes, set the configuration parameter `indexes` to a list of the index
names you want to collect stats for.

The call to collect index statistics can be CPU-intensive. For this reason
SignalFx recommends using the `indexStatsIntervalSeconds` configuration
parameter to decrease the reporting interval for nodes that report index
statistics.

### Primaries vs total
By default the monitor collects a subset of index stats of total aggregation
type (see docs for details). It is possible to enable index stats of primaries
aggregation type too. Total for an index stat aggregates across all shards.
Whereas, Primaries only reflect the stats from primary shards. An example
configuration to enable index stats from Primary shards too:

```yaml
monitors:
- type: elasticsearch
  host: localhost
  port: 9200
  enableIndexStatsPrimaries: true
```


## Configuration

To activate this monitor in the Smart Agent, add the following to your
agent config:

```
monitors:  # All monitor config goes under this key
 - type: elasticsearch
   ...  # Additional config
```

#### Group node/thread-pool
All of the following metrics are part of the `node/thread-pool` metric group. All of
the non-default metrics below can be turned on by adding `node/thread-pool` to the
monitor config option `extraGroups`:
 - `elasticsearch.thread_pool.active` (*gauge*)<br>    Number of active threads
 - `elasticsearch.thread_pool.completed` (*cumulative*)<br>    Number of threads completed in thread pool
 - `elasticsearch.thread_pool.largest` (*gauge*)<br>    Highest active threads in thread pool

 - ***`elasticsearch.thread_pool.rejected`*** (*cumulative*)<br>    Number of rejected threads in thread pool
 - `elasticsearch.thread_pool.threads` (*cumulative*)<br>    Number of Threads in thread pool

#### Group node/transport
All of the following metrics are part of the `node/transport` metric group. All of
the non-default metrics below can be turned on by adding `node/transport` to the
monitor config option `extraGroups`:

### Non-default metrics (version 4.7.0+)

**The following information applies to the agent version 4.7.0+ that has
`enableBuiltInFiltering: true` set on the top level of the agent config.**

To emit metrics that are not _default_, you can add those metrics in the
generic monitor-level `extraMetrics` config option.  Metrics that are derived
from specific configuration options that do not appear in the above list of
metrics do not need to be added to `extraMetrics`.

To see a list of metrics that will be emitted you can run `agent-status
monitors` after configuring this monitor in a running agent instance.

### Legacy non-default metrics (version < 4.7.0)

**The following information only applies to agent version older than 4.7.0. If
you have a newer agent and have set `enableBuiltInFiltering: true` at the top
level of your agent config, see the section above. See upgrade instructions in
[Old-style whitelist filtering](../legacy-filtering.html#old-style-whitelist-filtering).**

If you have a reference to the `whitelist.json` in your agent's top-level
`metricsToExclude` config option, and you want to emit metrics that are not in
that whitelist, then you need to add an item to the top-level
`metricsToInclude` config option to override that whitelist (see [Inclusion
filtering](../legacy-filtering.html#inclusion-filtering).  Or you can just
copy the whitelist.json, modify it, and reference that in `metricsToExclude`.

## Dimensions

The following dimensions may occur on metrics emitted by this monitor.  Some
dimensions may be specific to certain metrics.

| Name | Description |
| ---  | ---         |
| `aggregation` | Aggregation of index metrics. Whether the value of the metric is from the primary shard only or across all shards. Valid values - primaries, total respectively (only on index stats) |
| `cluster` | Name of Elasticsearch the cluster. |
| `index` | Name of index (only on per index mertics) |
| `node_id` | ID of a Elasticsearch node (only on node mertics) |
| `node_name` | Human readable name of a node (only on node mertics) |
| `plugin_instance` | Name of the Elasticsearch cluster. For compatibility with collectd/elasticsearch built-in content |
| `thread_pool` | Name of thread pool (only on thread pool mertics) |
