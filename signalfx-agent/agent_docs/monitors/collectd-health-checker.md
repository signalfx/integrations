# collectd/health-checker

Monitor Type: `collectd/health-checker` ([Source](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/main/pkg/monitors/collectd/healthchecker))

**Accepts Endpoints**: **Yes**

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: Yes

## Overview

A simple Collectd Python-based monitor
that hits an endpoint and checks if the configured JSON value is returned in
the response body.


## Configuration

To activate this monitor in the Smart Agent, add the following to your
agent config:

```
monitors:  # All monitor config goes under this key
 - type: collectd/health-checker
   ...  # Additional config
```

**For a list of monitor options that are common to all monitors, see [Common
Configuration](../monitor-config.html#common-configuration).**


| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `pythonBinary` | no | `string` | Path to a python binary that should be used to execute the Python code. If not set, a built-in runtime will be used.  Can include arguments to the binary as well. |
| `host` | **yes** | `string` |  |
| `port` | **yes** | `integer` |  |
| `name` | no | `string` |  |
| `path` | no | `string` | The HTTP path that contains a JSON document to verify (**default:** `/`) |
| `jsonKey` | no | `string` | If `jsonKey` and `jsonVal` are given, the given endpoint will be interpreted as a JSON document and will be expected to contain the given key and value for the service to be considered healthy. |
| `jsonVal` | no | `any` | This can be either a string or numeric type |
| `useHTTPS` | no | `bool` | If true, the endpoint will be connected to on HTTPS instead of plain HTTP.  It is invalid to specify this if `tcpCheck` is true. (**default:** `false`) |
| `skipSecurity` | no | `bool` | If true, and `useHTTPS` is true, the server's SSL/TLS cert will not be verified. (**default:** `false`) |
| `tcpCheck` | no | `bool` | If true, the plugin will verify that it can connect to the given host/port value. JSON checking is not supported. (**default:** `false`) |



The agent does not do any built-in filtering of metrics coming out of this
monitor.
