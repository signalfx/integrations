# http

Monitor Type: `http` ([Source](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/pkg/monitors/http))

**Accepts Endpoints**: **Yes**

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: Yes

## Overview

This monitor will generate metrics based on whether the HTTP responses from
the configured URLs match expectations (e.g. correct body, status code,
etc).

TLS information will automatically be fetched if applicable (from base URL
or redirection).

The configuration will be applied to every requests URLs from configured
list so you need to instance multiple times this monitor for different
behavior on multiple URLs.


## Configuration

To activate this monitor in the Smart Agent, add the following to your
agent config:

```
monitors:  # All monitor config goes under this key
 - type: http
   ...  # Additional config
```

**For a list of monitor options that are common to all monitors, see [Common
Configuration](../monitor-config.html#common-configuration).**


| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `host` | no | `string` | Host/IP to monitor |
| `port` | no | `integer` | Port of the HTTP server to monitor (**default:** `0`) |
| `path` | no | `string` | HTTP path to use in the test request |
| `httpTimeout` | no | `int64` | HTTP timeout duration for both read and writes. This should be a duration string that is accepted by https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration (**default:** `10s`) |
| `username` | no | `string` | Basic Auth username to use on each request, if any. |
| `password` | no | `string` | Basic Auth password to use on each request, if any. |
| `useHTTPS` | no | `bool` | If true, the agent will connect to the server using HTTPS instead of plain HTTP. (**default:** `false`) |
| `httpHeaders` | no | `map of strings` | A map of HTTP header names to values. Comma separated multiple values for the same message-header is supported. |
| `skipVerify` | no | `bool` | If useHTTPS is true and this option is also true, the exporter's TLS cert will not be verified. (**default:** `false`) |
| `caCertPath` | no | `string` | Path to the CA cert that has signed the TLS cert, unnecessary if `skipVerify` is set to false. |
| `clientCertPath` | no | `string` | Path to the client TLS cert to use for TLS required connections |
| `clientKeyPath` | no | `string` | Path to the client TLS key to use for TLS required connections |
| `requestBody` | no | `string` | Optional HTTP request body as string like '{"foo":"bar"}' |
| `noRedirects` | no | `bool` | Do not follow redirect. (**default:** `false`) |
| `method` | no | `string` | HTTP request method to use. (**default:** `GET`) |
| `urls` | no | `list of strings` | DEPRECATED: list of HTTP URLs to monitor. Use `host`/`port`/`useHTTPS`/`path` instead. |
| `regex` | no | `string` | Optional Regex to match on URL(s) response(s). |
| `desiredCode` | no | `integer` | Desired code to match for URL(s) response(s). (**default:** `200`) |


## Metrics

These are the metrics available for this monitor.
Metrics that are categorized as
[container/host](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/admin-guide/usage.html#about-custom-bundled-and-high-resolution-metrics)
(*default*) are ***in bold and italics*** in the list below.


 - ***`http.cert_expiry`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Certificate expiry in seconds. This metric is reported only if HTTPS is available (from last followed URL).
 - ***`http.cert_valid`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Value is 1 if certificate is valid (including expiration test) or 0 else. This metric is reported only if HTTPS is available (from last followed URL).
 - ***`http.code_matched`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Value is 1 if `status_code` value match `desiredCode` set in config. Always reported.
 - ***`http.content_length`*** (*gauge*)<br>    HTTP response body length. Always reported.
 - ***`http.regex_matched`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Value is 1 if pattern match in response body. Only reported if `regex` is configured.
 - ***`http.response_time`*** (*gauge*)<br>    HTTP response time in seconds. Always reported.
 - ***`http.status_code`*** (*gauge*)<br>    HTTP response status code. Always reported.

### Non-default metrics (version 4.7.0+)

To emit metrics that are not _default_, you can add those metrics in the
generic monitor-level `extraMetrics` config option.  Metrics that are derived
from specific configuration options that do not appear in the above list of
metrics do not need to be added to `extraMetrics`.

To see a list of metrics that will be emitted you can run `agent-status
monitors` after configuring this monitor in a running agent instance.

## Dimensions

The following dimensions may occur on metrics emitted by this monitor.  Some
dimensions may be specific to certain metrics.

| Name | Description |
| ---  | ---         |
| `method` | HTTP method used to do request. Not available on `http.cert_*` metrics. |
| `original_url` | The original URL used in the configuration of this monitor.  May differ from `url` if the URL responds with a redirect and `noRedirects: false`. |
| `server_name` | ServerName used for TLS validation. Always and only available on `http.cert_expiry` metric. |
| `url` | Last URL retrieved (after redirects) from configured one. Always available on every metrics. |
