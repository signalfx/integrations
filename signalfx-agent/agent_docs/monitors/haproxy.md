# haproxy

Monitor Type: `haproxy` ([Source](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/main/pkg/monitors/haproxy))

**Accepts Endpoints**: **Yes**

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: Yes

## Overview

This monitor scrapes [HAProxy](http://www.haproxy.org/) statistics (i.e. metrics) from a configured
HTTP endpoint or UNIX socket. It requires HAProxy 1.8+ and supports scraping metrics for HAProxy running in
multi-process mode. In multi-process mode, HAProxy must be configured to enable stats on different URLs/socket
paths for the processes and for each URL/path a monitor instance needs to be defined and configured.

<!--- SETUP --->
### HTTP Endpoint Config
HAProxy stats must be enabled as described [here](https://www.haproxy.com/blog/exploring-the-haproxy-stats-page/).
Define the HAProxy monitor in the agent configuration file and provide the `csv export` URL where HAProxy
stats are served in CSV format. This monitor supports basic HTTP authentication. Simply provide the
username and password. In multi-process mode, declare and configure monitors for each stats HTTP endpoint. Below
below is an example showing stats enable on 2 URLs.
```
...
monitors:
  - type: haproxy
    url: "http://localhost:8404/stats?stats;csv"
    username: "your username here"
    password: "your password here"
  - type: haproxy
    url: "http://localhost:6000/stats?stats;csv"
...
```
Note: Only stats pertaining to the configured proxies (i.e. listeners, frontends, backends, and servers)
are available from the HTTP url. HAProxy process level stats given by command [show info](https://cbonte.github.io/haproxy-dconv/1.8/management.html#9.3-show%20info)
are not available. The `show info` stats can only be scraped from a UNIX socket.

### UNIX Socket Config
The location of the HAProxy socket file is defined in the HAProxy config file. For example:
```
global
    daemon
    stats socket /var/run/haproxy.sock
    stats timeout 2m
```
For the above location of the socket file, configure the monitor URL as shown below:
```
...
monitors:
  - type: haproxy
    url: "unix:///var/run/haproxy.sock"
...
```
Note: The agent process needs read/write permissions to the HAProxy socket file.


## Configuration

To activate this monitor in the Smart Agent, add the following to your
agent config:

```
monitors:  # All monitor config goes under this key
 - type: haproxy
   ...  # Additional config
```

**For a list of monitor options that are common to all monitors, see [Common
Configuration](../monitor-config.html#common-configuration).**


| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `host` | no | `string` | The host/ip address of the HAProxy instance. This is used to construct the `url` option if not provided. |
| `port` | no | `integer` | The port of the HAProxy instance's stats endpoint (if using HTTP). This is used to construct the `url` option if not provided. (**default:** `0`) |
| `path` | no | `string` | The path to HAProxy stats. The default is `stats?stats;csv`. This is used to construct the `url` option if not provided. (**default:** `stats?stats;csv`) |
| `useHTTPS` | no | `bool` | Whether to connect on HTTPS or HTTP. If you want to use a UNIX socket, then specify the `url` config option with the format `unix://...` and omit `host`, `port` and `useHTTPS`. (**default:** `false`) |
| `url` | no | `string` | URL on which to scrape HAProxy. Scheme `http://` for http-type and `unix://` socket-type urls. If this is not provided, it will be derive from the `host`, `port`, `path`, and `useHTTPS` options. |
| `username` | no | `string` | Basic Auth username to use on each request, if any. |
| `password` | no | `string` | Basic Auth password to use on each request, if any. |
| `sslVerify` | no | `bool` | Flag that enables SSL certificate verification for the scrape URL. (**default:** `true`) |
| `timeout` | no | `int64` | Timeout for trying to get stats from HAProxy. This should be a duration string that is accepted by https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration (**default:** `5s`) |
| `proxies` | no | `list of strings` | A list of the pxname(s) and svname(s) to monitor (e.g. `["http-in", "server1", "backend"]`). If empty then metrics for all proxies will be reported. |

### Non-default metrics (version 4.7.0+)

To emit metrics that are not _default_, you can add those metrics in the
generic monitor-level `extraMetrics` config option.  Metrics that are derived
from specific configuration options that do not appear in the above list of
metrics do not need to be added to `extraMetrics`.

To see a list of metrics that will be emitted you can run `agent-status
monitors` after configuring this monitor in a running agent instance.

## Dimensions

The following dimensions may occur on metrics emitted by this monitor.  Some
dimensions may be specific to certain metrics.

| Name | Description |
| ---  | ---         |
| `process_id` | A number assigned to an HAProxy process instance (1 for first instance, 2 for second, ...). |
| `proxy_name` | HAProxy configured proxy name. Possible values for listeners, frontends, backends, and servers. |
| `server_id` | Server id (unique inside a proxy) |
| `service_name` | HAProxy configured service name. Possible values are FRONTEND for frontend, BACKEND for backend, configured name for server/listener. |
| `type` | Proxy type id (0=frontend, 1=backend, 2=server, 3=socket/listener). |
| `unique_proxy_id` | A unique proxy id |
