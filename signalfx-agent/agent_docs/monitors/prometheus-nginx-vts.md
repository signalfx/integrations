# prometheus/nginx-vts

Monitor Type: `prometheus/nginx-vts` ([Source](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/internal/monitors/prometheus/nginxvts))

**Accepts Endpoints**: **Yes**

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: Yes

## Overview

This monitor scrapes [Prmoetheus Nginx VTS
exporter](https://github.com/hnlq715/nginx-vts-exporter) metrics from a
Prometheus exporter and sends them to SignalFx.  It is a wrapper around the
[prometheus-exporter](./prometheus-exporter.md) monitor that provides a
restricted but expandable set of metrics.


## Configuration

To activate this monitor in the Smart Agent, add the following to your
agent config:

```
monitors:  # All monitor config goes under this key
 - type: prometheus/nginx-vts
   ...  # Additional config
```

**For a list of monitor options that are common to all monitors, see [Common
Configuration](../monitor-config.html#common-configuration).**


| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `host` | **yes** | `string` | Host of the exporter |
| `port` | **yes** | `integer` | Port of the exporter |
| `username` | no | `string` | Basic Auth username to use on each request, if any. |
| `password` | no | `string` | Basic Auth password to use on each request, if any. |
| `useHTTPS` | no | `bool` | If true, the agent will connect to the exporter using HTTPS instead of plain HTTP. (**default:** `false`) |
| `skipVerify` | no | `bool` | If useHTTPS is true and this option is also true, the exporter's TLS cert will not be verified. (**default:** `false`) |
| `caCertPath` | no | `string` | Path to the CA cert that has signed the TLS cert, unnecessary if `skipVerify` is set to false. |
| `clientCertPath` | no | `string` | Path to the client TLS cert to use for TLS required connections |
| `clientKeyPath` | no | `string` | Path to the client TLS key to use for TLS required connections |
| `httpTimeout` | no | `int64` | HTTP timeout duration for both read and writes. This should be a duration string that is accepted by https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration (**default:** `10s`) |
| `useServiceAccount` | no | `bool` | Use pod service account to authenticate. (**default:** `false`) |
| `metricPath` | no | `string` | Path to the metrics endpoint on the exporter server, usually `/metrics` (the default). (**default:** `/metrics`) |
| `sendAllMetrics` | no | `bool` | Send all the metrics that come out of the Prometheus exporter without any filtering.  This option has no effect when using the prometheus exporter monitor directly since there is no built-in filtering, only when embedding it in other monitors. (**default:** `false`) |


## Metrics

These are the metrics available for this monitor.
Metrics that are categorized as
[container/host](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/admin-guide/usage.html#about-custom-bundled-and-high-resolution-metrics)
(*default*) are ***in bold and italics*** in the list below.


 - `nginx_vts_info` (*gauge*)<br>    Nginx info
 - ***`nginx_vts_main_connections`*** (*gauge*)<br>    connections
 - `nginx_vts_main_shm_usage_bytes` (*gauge*)<br>    Shared memory [ngx_http_vhost_traffic_status] info
 - `nginx_vts_server_bytes_total` (*cumulative*)<br>    The request/response bytes
 - `nginx_vts_server_cache_total` (*cumulative*)<br>    The requests cache counter
 - `nginx_vts_server_request_duration_seconds` (*cumulative*)<br>    The histogram of request processing time
 - ***`nginx_vts_server_request_seconds`*** (*gauge*)<br>    The average of request processing times in seconds
 - `nginx_vts_server_request_seconds_total` (*cumulative*)<br>    The request processing time in seconds
 - ***`nginx_vts_server_requests_total`*** (*cumulative*)<br>    The requests counter
 - `nginx_vts_start_time_seconds` (*gauge*)<br>    Nginx start time
 - `nginx_vts_upstream_bytes_total` (*cumulative*)<br>    The request/response bytes
 - `nginx_vts_upstream_request_duration_seconds` (*cumulative*)<br>    The histogram of request processing time including upstream
 - ***`nginx_vts_upstream_request_seconds`*** (*gauge*)<br>    The average of request processing times including upstream in seconds
 - `nginx_vts_upstream_request_seconds_total` (*cumulative*)<br>    The request Processing time including upstream in seconds
 - `nginx_vts_upstream_requests_total` (*cumulative*)<br>    The upstream requests counter
 - `nginx_vts_upstream_response_duration_seconds` (*cumulative*)<br>    The histogram of only upstream response processing time
 - `nginx_vts_upstream_response_seconds` (*gauge*)<br>    The average of only upstream response processing times in seconds
 - `nginx_vts_upstream_response_seconds_total` (*cumulative*)<br>    The only upstream response processing time in seconds

### Non-default metrics (version 4.7.0+)

**The following information applies to the agent version 4.7.0+ that has
`enableBuiltInFiltering: true` set on the top level of the agent config.**

To emit metrics that are not _default_, you can add those metrics in the
generic monitor-level `extraMetrics` config option.  Metrics that are derived
from specific configuration options that do not appear in the above list of
metrics do not need to be added to `extraMetrics`.

To see a list of metrics that will be emitted you can run `agent-status
monitors` after configuring this monitor in a running agent instance.

### Legacy non-default metrics (version < 4.7.0)

**The following information only applies to agent version older than 4.7.0. If
you have a newer agent and have set `enableBuiltInFiltering: true` at the top
level of your agent config, see the section above. See upgrade instructions in
[Old-style whitelist filtering](../legacy-filtering.html#old-style-whitelist-filtering).**

If you have a reference to the `whitelist.json` in your agent's top-level
`metricsToExclude` config option, and you want to emit metrics that are not in
that whitelist, then you need to add an item to the top-level
`metricsToInclude` config option to override that whitelist (see [Inclusion
filtering](../legacy-filtering.html#inclusion-filtering).  Or you can just
copy the whitelist.json, modify it, and reference that in `metricsToExclude`.
