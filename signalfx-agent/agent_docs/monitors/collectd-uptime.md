# collectd/uptime

Monitor Type: `collectd/uptime` ([Source](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/main/pkg/monitors/collectd/uptime))

**Accepts Endpoints**: No

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: **No**

## Overview

Sends a single metric of the total number of
seconds the host has been up, using the [collectd uptime
plugin](https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:Uptime).


## Configuration

To activate this monitor in the Smart Agent, add the following to your
agent config:

```
monitors:  # All monitor config goes under this key
 - type: collectd/uptime
   ...  # Additional config
```

**For a list of monitor options that are common to all monitors, see [Common
Configuration](../monitor-config.html#common-configuration).**


This monitor has no configuration options.
## Metrics

These are the metrics available for this monitor.
Metrics that are categorized as
[container/host](https://docs.splunk.com/observability/admin/subscription-usage/monitor-imm-billing-usage.html#about-custom-bundled-and-high-resolution-metrics)
(*default*) are ***in bold and italics*** in the list below.


 - ***`uptime`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Seconds since system boot

### Non-default metrics (version 4.7.0+)

To emit metrics that are not _default_, you can add those metrics in the
generic monitor-level `extraMetrics` config option.  Metrics that are derived
from specific configuration options that do not appear in the above list of
metrics do not need to be added to `extraMetrics`.

To see a list of metrics that will be emitted you can run `agent-status
monitors` after configuring this monitor in a running agent instance.
