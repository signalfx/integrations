# collectd/kong

Monitor Type: `collectd/kong` ([Source](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/pkg/monitors/collectd/kong))

**Accepts Endpoints**: **Yes**

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: Yes

## Overview

Monitors a Kong instance using
[collectd-kong](https://github.com/signalfx/collectd-kong).  The Smart
Agent includes collectd and this plugin as part of the standard
installation, so no additional installation is required once you have the
Smart Agent.

The SignalFx Kong collectd plugin provides users with the ability to gather
and report their service traffic metrics with collectd, in tandem with
[kong-plugin-signalfx](https://github.com/signalfx/kong-plugin-signalfx).

This plugin emits metrics for configurable request/response lifecycle groups including:

* Counters for response counts
* Counters for cumulative response and request sizes
* Counters for cumulative request, upstream, and Kong latencies

These request/response lifecycle groups can be optionally partitioned by tunable levels of granularity by:

* API or Service Name/ID
* Route ID
* Request HTTP Method
* Response HTTP Status Code

In addition to these groups, system-wide connection stats can be provided, including:

* A counter for total fielded requests
* Gauges for active connections and their various states
* A gauge for database connectivity

The `metrics` field below is populated with a set of metrics that are
described at https://github.com/signalfx/collectd-kong/blob/master/README.md.

### Non-default metrics (version 4.7.0+)

To emit metrics that are not _default_, you can add those metrics in the
generic monitor-level `extraMetrics` config option.  Metrics that are derived
from specific configuration options that do not appear in the above list of
metrics do not need to be added to `extraMetrics`.

To see a list of metrics that will be emitted you can run `agent-status
monitors` after configuring this monitor in a running agent instance.
