# processlist

Monitor Type: `processlist` ([Source](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/pkg/monitors/processlist))

**Accepts Endpoints**: No

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: **No**

## Overview

This monitor reports the currently running processes for a host, analogous
to how the `top` or `ps` command on Unix/Linux systems works.  The output
format is a special base64-encoded event that gets processed by our backend
and displayed under the Infrastructure view for a specific host.
Historical process information is not retained on the backend, only the
most recent version.


## Configuration

To activate this monitor in the Smart Agent, add the following to your
agent config:

```
monitors:  # All monitor config goes under this key
 - type: processlist
   ...  # Additional config
```

**For a list of monitor options that are common to all monitors, see [Common
Configuration](../monitor-config.html#common-configuration).**


This monitor has no configuration options.
