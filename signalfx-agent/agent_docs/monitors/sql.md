# sql

Monitor Type: `sql` ([Source](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/internal/monitors/sql))

**Accepts Endpoints**: **Yes**

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: Yes

## Overview

Run arbitrary SQL queries against a relational database and use the results to generate dataponts.

For example, if you had a database table `customers` that looked like:

| id | name       | country | status   |
|----|------------|---------|----------|
| 1  | Bill       | USA     | active   |
| 2  | Mary       | USA     | inactive |
| 3  | Joe        | USA     | active   |
| 4  | Elizabeth  | Germany | active   |

You could use the following monitor config to generate metrics about active users and customer counts by country:

```yaml
monitors:
  - type: sql
    host: localhost
    port: 5432
    dbDriver: postgres
    params:
      user: admin
      password: s3cr3t
    # The `host` and `port` values from above (or provided through auto-discovery) should be interpolated
    # to the connection string as appropriate for your database driver.
    # Also, the values from the `params` config option above can be
    # interpolated.
    connectionString: 'host={{.host}} port={{.port}} dbname=main user={{.user}} password={{.password}} sslmode=disabled'
    queries:
      - query: 'SELECT COUNT(*) as count, country, status FROM customers GROUP BY country, status;'
        metrics:
          - metricName: "customers"
            valueColumn: "count"
            dimensionColumns: ["country", "status"]
```

This would generate a series of timeseries, all with the metric name
`customers` that includes a `county` and `status` dimension.  The value
is the number of customers that belong to that combination of `country`
and `status`.  You could also specify multiple `metrics` items to
generate more than one metric from a single query.

## Supported Drivers

The `dbDriver` config option must specify the database driver to use.
These are equivalent to the name of the Golang SQL driver used in the
agent.  The `connectionString` option will be formatted according to the
driver that is going to receive it.  Here is a list of the drivers we
currently support and documentation on the connection string:

  - `postgres`: https://godoc.org/github.com/lib/pq#hdr-Connection_String_Parameters
  - `mysql`: https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql#dsn-data-source-name
  - `mssql`: https://github.com/denisenkom/go-mssqldb#connection-parameters-and-dsn

## Parameterized Connection String

The `connectionString` config option acts as a template with a context
consisting of the variables: `host`, `port`, and all the values from
the `params` config option map.  You interpolate variables into it
with the Go template syntax `{{.varname}}` (see example config
above).


## Configuration

To activate this monitor in the Smart Agent, add the following to your
agent config:

```
monitors:  # All monitor config goes under this key
 - type: sql
   ...  # Additional config
```

**For a list of monitor options that are common to all monitors, see [Common
Configuration](../monitor-config.html#common-configuration).**


| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `host` | no | `string` |  |
| `port` | no | `integer` |  (**default:** `0`) |
| `params` | no | `map of strings` | Parameters to the connectionString that can be templated into that option using Go template syntax (e.g. `{{.key}}`). |
| `dbDriver` | no | `string` | The database driver to use, valid values are `postgres` and `mysql`. |
| `connectionString` | no | `string` | A URL or simple option string used to connect to the database. If using PostgreSQL, [see the list of connection string params](https://godoc.org/github.com/lib/pq#hdr-Connection_String_Parameters). |
| `queries` | **yes** | `list of objects (see below)` | A list of queries to make against the database that are used to generate datapoints. |
| `logQueries` | no | `bool` | If true, query results will be logged at the info level. (**default:** `false`) |


The **nested** `queries` config object has the following fields:

| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `query` | **yes** | `string` | A SQL query text that selects one or more rows from a database |
| `params` | no | `list of any` | Optional parameters that will replace placeholders in the query string. |
| `metrics` | no | `list of objects (see below)` | Metrics that should be generated from the query. |


The **nested** `metrics` config object has the following fields:

| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `metricName` | **yes** | `string` | The name of the metric as it will appear in SignalFx. |
| `valueColumn` | **yes** | `string` | The column name that holds the datapoint value |
| `dimensionColumns` | no | `list of strings` | The names of the columns that should make up the dimensions of the datapoint. |
| `isCumulative` | no | `bool` | Whether the value is a cumulative counters (true) or gauge (false).  If you set this to the wrong value and send in your first datapoint for the metric name with the wrong type, you will have to manually change the type in SignalFx, as it is set in the system based on the first type seen. (**default:** `false`) |



The agent does not do any built-in filtering of metrics coming out of this
monitor.
