# sql

Monitor Type: `sql` ([Source](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/main/pkg/monitors/sql))

**Accepts Endpoints**: **Yes**

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: Yes

## Overview

Run arbitrary SQL queries against a relational database and use the results to generate dataponts.

For example, if you had a database table `customers` that looked like:

| id | name       | country | status   |
|----|------------|---------|----------|
| 1  | Bill       | USA     | active   |
| 2  | Mary       | USA     | inactive |
| 3  | Joe        | USA     | active   |
| 4  | Elizabeth  | Germany | active   |

You could use the following monitor config to generate metrics about active users and customer counts by country:

```yaml
monitors:
  - type: sql
    host: localhost
    port: 5432
    dbDriver: postgres
    params:
      user: admin
      password: s3cr3t
    # The `host` and `port` values from above (or provided through auto-discovery) should be interpolated
    # to the connection string as appropriate for your database driver.
    # Also, the values from the `params` config option above can be
    # interpolated.
    connectionString: 'host={{.host}} port={{.port}} dbname=main user={{.user}} password={{.password}} sslmode=disable'
    queries:
      - query: 'SELECT COUNT(*) as count, country, status FROM customers GROUP BY country, status;'
        metrics:
          - metricName: "customers"
            valueColumn: "count"
            dimensionColumns: ["country", "status"]
```

This would generate a series of timeseries, all with the metric name
`customers` that includes a `county` and `status` dimension.  The value
is the number of customers that belong to that combination of `country`
and `status`.  You could also specify multiple `metrics` items to
generate more than one metric from a single query.

## Metric Expressions

**Metric Expressions are a beta feature and may break in subsequent
non-major releases.  The example documented will be maintained for backwards
compatibility, however.**

If you need to do more complex logic than simply mapping columns to metric
values and dimensions, you can use the `datapointExpressions` option to the
individual metric configurations.  This allows you to use the
[expr](https://github.com/antonmedv/expr/blob/master/docs/Language-Definition.md)
expression language to derive datapoints from individual rows using more
sophisticated logic.  These expressions should evaluate to datapoints
created by the `GAUGE` or `CUMULATIVE` helper functions available in the
expression's context.  You can also have the expression evaluate to `nil`
if no datapoint should be generated for a particular row.

The signature for both the `GAUGE` and `CUMULATIVE` functions is
`(metricName, dimensions, value)`, where `metricName` should be a string
value, `dimensions` should be a map of string keys and values, and `value`
should be any numeric value.

Each of the columns in the row is mapped to a variable in the context of
the expression with the same name.  So if there was a column called `name`
in your SQL query result, there will be a variable called `name` that you
can use in the expression.  Note that literal string values used in your
expressions must be surrounded by `"`.

For example, the MySQL [SHOW SLAVE STATS
query](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/show-slave-status.html)
does not let you pre-process columns using SQL but let us say
you wanted to convert the `Slave_IO_Running` column, which is a
string `Yes`/`No` value, to a gauge datapoint that has a value
of 0 or 1.  You can do that with the following configuration:

```yaml
   - type: sql
     # Example discovery rule, your environment will probably be different
     discoveryRule: container_labels["mysql.slave"] == "true" && port == 3306
     dbDriver: mysql
     params:
       user: root
       password: password
     connectionString: '{{.user}}:{{.password}}@tcp({{.host}})/mysql'
     queries:
      - query: 'SHOW SLAVE STATUS'
        datapointExpressions:
          - 'GAUGE("mysql.slave_sql_running", {master_uuid: Master_UUID, channel: Channel_name}, Slave_SQL_Running == "Yes" ? 1 : 0)'
```

This would generate a single gauge datapoint for each row in the slave
status output, with two dimension, `master_uuid` and `channel` and with a
value of 0 or 1 depending on if the slave's SQL thread is running.


## Supported Drivers

The `dbDriver` config option must specify the database driver to use.
These are equivalent to the name of the Golang SQL driver used in the
agent.  The `connectionString` option will be formatted according to the
driver that is going to receive it.  Here is a list of the drivers we
currently support and documentation on the connection string:

  - `postgres`: https://godoc.org/github.com/lib/pq#hdr-Connection_String_Parameters
  - `mysql`: https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql#dsn-data-source-name
  - `sqlserver`: https://github.com/denisenkom/go-mssqldb#connection-parameters-and-dsn
  - `snowflake`: https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/snowflakedb/gosnowflake#hdr-Connection_Parameters

## Parameterized Connection String

The `connectionString` config option acts as a template with a context
consisting of the variables: `host`, `port`, and all the values from
the `params` config option map.  You interpolate variables into it
with the Go template syntax `{{.varname}}` (see example config
above).

## Snowflake Performance and Usage Metrics

To configure the agent to collect Snowflake performance and usage metrics:
- Copy pkg/sql/snowflake-metrics.yaml from this repo into the same location as your agent.yaml file (for example, /etc/signalfx).
- Configure the sql monitor as follows:
```
monitors:
  - type: sql
    intervalSeconds: 3600
    dbDriver: snowflake
    params:
      account: "account.region"
      database: "SNOWFLAKE"
      schema: "ACCOUNT_USAGE"
      role: "ACCOUNTADMIN"
      user: "user"
      password: "password"
    connectionString: "{{.user}}:{{.password}}@{{.account}}/{{.database}}/{{.schema}}?role={{.role}}"
    queries: 
      {"#from": "/etc/signalfx/snowflake-metrics.yaml"}
```

You can also cut/paste the contents of snowflake-metrics.yaml into agent.yaml under "queries" if needed or preferred.  And you can edit snowflake-metrics.yaml to only include metrics you care about.


## Configuration

To activate this monitor in the Smart Agent, add the following to your
agent config:

```
monitors:  # All monitor config goes under this key
 - type: sql
   ...  # Additional config
```

**For a list of monitor options that are common to all monitors, see [Common
Configuration](../monitor-config.html#common-configuration).**


| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `host` | no | `string` |  |
| `port` | no | `integer` |  (**default:** `0`) |
| `params` | no | `map of strings` | Parameters to the connectionString that can be templated into that option using Go template syntax (e.g. `{{.key}}`). |
| `dbDriver` | no | `string` | The database driver to use, valid values are `postgres`, `mysql`, `sqlserver`, and `snowflake`. |
| `connectionString` | no | `string` | A URL or simple option string used to connect to the database. For example, if using PostgreSQL, [see the list of connection string params](https://godoc.org/github.com/lib/pq#hdr-Connection_String_Parameters). |
| `queries` | **yes** | `list of objects (see below)` | A list of queries to make against the database that are used to generate datapoints. |
| `logQueries` | no | `bool` | If true, query results will be logged at the info level. (**default:** `false`) |


The **nested** `queries` config object has the following fields:

| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `query` | **yes** | `string` | A SQL query text that selects one or more rows from a database |
| `params` | no | `list of any` | Optional parameters that will replace placeholders in the query string. |
| `metrics` | no | `list of objects (see below)` | Metrics that should be generated from the query. |
| `datapointExpressions` | no | `list of strings` | A set of [expr] expressions that will be used to convert each row to a set of metrics.  Each of these will be run for each row in the query result set, allowing you to generate multiple datapoints per row.  Each expression should evaluate to a single datapoint or nil. |


The **nested** `metrics` config object has the following fields:

| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `metricName` | **yes** | `string` | The name of the metric as it will appear in SignalFx. |
| `valueColumn` | **yes** | `string` | The column name that holds the datapoint value |
| `dimensionColumns` | no | `list of strings` | The names of the columns that should make up the dimensions of the datapoint. |
| `isCumulative` | no | `bool` | Whether the value is a cumulative counters (true) or gauge (false).  If you set this to the wrong value and send in your first datapoint for the metric name with the wrong type, you will have to manually change the type in SignalFx, as it is set in the system based on the first type seen. (**default:** `false`) |
| `dimensionPropertyColumns` | no | `map of lists` | The mapping between dimensions and the columns to be used to attach respective properties |



The agent does not do any built-in filtering of metrics coming out of this
monitor.
