# cadvisor

Monitor Type: `cadvisor` ([Source](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/pkg/monitors/cadvisor))

**Accepts Endpoints**: No

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: Yes

## Overview

This monitor pulls metrics directly from cadvisor, which
conventionally runs on port 4194, but can be configured to anything.  If you
are running on Kubernetes, consider the [kubelet-stats](./kubelet-stats.md)
monitor because many K8s nodes do not expose cAdvisor on a network port,
even though they are running it within Kubelet.

If you are running containers with Docker, there is a fair amount of
duplication with the `docker-container-stats` monitor in terms of the
metrics sent (under distinct metric names) so you may want to consider not
enabling the Docker monitor in a K8s environment, or else use filtering to
allow only certain metrics.  Note that this will cause the built-in
Docker dashboards to be blank, but container metrics will be available on
the Kubernetes dashboards instead.


## Configuration

To activate this monitor in the Smart Agent, add the following to your
agent config:

```
monitors:  # All monitor config goes under this key
 - type: cadvisor
   ...  # Additional config
```

**For a list of monitor options that are common to all monitors, see [Common
Configuration](../monitor-config.html#common-configuration).**


| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `cadvisorURL` | no | `string` | Where to find cAdvisor (**default:** `http://localhost:4194`) |


## Metrics

These are the metrics available for this monitor.
Metrics that are categorized as
[container/host](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/admin-guide/usage.html#about-custom-bundled-and-high-resolution-metrics)
(*default*) are ***in bold and italics*** in the list below.


 - `container_cpu_cfs_periods` (*cumulative*)<br>    Total number of elapsed CFS enforcement intervals
 - `container_cpu_cfs_throttled_periods` (*cumulative*)<br>    Total number of times tasks in the cgroup have been throttled
 - `container_cpu_cfs_throttled_time` (*cumulative*)<br>    Total time duration, in nanoseconds, for which tasks in the cgroup have been throttled
 - ***`container_cpu_percent`*** (*cumulative*)<br>    Cumulative cpu utilization as a percentage of the total host CPU available.  This metric is equivalent to `container_cpu_utilization` / <# of CPUs/cores on host>.
 - `container_cpu_system_seconds_total` (*cumulative*)<br>    Cumulative system cpu time consumed in nanoseconds
 - `container_cpu_usage_seconds_total` (*cumulative*)<br>    Cumulative cpu time consumed per cpu in nanoseconds
 - `container_cpu_user_seconds_total` (*cumulative*)<br>    Cumulative user cpu time consumed in nanoseconds
 - ***`container_cpu_utilization`*** (*cumulative*)<br>    Cumulative cpu utilization in percentages.  This is equivalent to "centicores", or hundreths of CPU cores consumed.  This metric is **NOT** normalized by the total # of cores on the system.
 - `container_cpu_utilization_per_core` (*cumulative*)<br>    Cumulative cpu utilization in percentages per core
 - `container_fs_io_current` (*gauge*)<br>    Number of I/Os currently in progress
 - `container_fs_io_time_seconds_total` (*cumulative*)<br>    Cumulative count of seconds spent doing I/Os
 - `container_fs_io_time_weighted_seconds_total` (*cumulative*)<br>    Cumulative weighted I/O time in seconds
 - `container_fs_limit_bytes` (*gauge*)<br>    Number of bytes that the container may occupy on this filesystem
 - ***`container_fs_read_seconds_total`*** (*cumulative*)<br>    Cumulative count of seconds spent reading
 - `container_fs_reads_merged_total` (*cumulative*)<br>    Cumulative count of reads merged
 - ***`container_fs_reads_total`*** (*cumulative*)<br>    Cumulative count of reads completed
 - `container_fs_sector_reads_total` (*cumulative*)<br>    Cumulative count of sector reads completed
 - `container_fs_sector_writes_total` (*cumulative*)<br>    Cumulative count of sector writes completed
 - ***`container_fs_usage_bytes`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Number of bytes that are consumed by the container on this filesystem
 - ***`container_fs_write_seconds_total`*** (*cumulative*)<br>    Cumulative count of seconds spent writing
 - `container_fs_writes_merged_total` (*cumulative*)<br>    Cumulative count of writes merged
 - ***`container_fs_writes_total`*** (*cumulative*)<br>    Cumulative count of writes completed
 - `container_last_seen` (*gauge*)<br>    Last time a container was seen by the exporter
 - `container_memory_failcnt` (*cumulative*)<br>    Number of memory usage hits limits
 - ***`container_memory_failures_total`*** (*cumulative*)<br>    Cumulative count of memory allocation failures
 - `container_memory_rss` (*gauge*)<br>    Current RSS memory usage in bytes
 - ***`container_memory_usage_bytes`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Current memory usage in bytes
 - `container_memory_working_set_bytes` (*gauge*)<br>    Current working set in bytes
 - ***`container_spec_cpu_period`*** (*gauge*)<br>    The number of microseconds that the [CFS scheduler](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/scheduler/sched-bwc.txt) uses as a window when limiting container processes
 - ***`container_spec_cpu_quota`*** (*gauge*)<br>    In CPU quota for the CFS process scheduler. In K8s this is equal to the containers's CPU limit as a fraction of 1 core and multiplied by the `container_spec_cpu_period`.  So if the CPU limit is `500m` (500 millicores) for a container and the `container_spec_cpu_period` is set to 100,000, this value will be 50,000.
 - `container_spec_cpu_shares` (*gauge*)<br>    CPU share of the container
 - ***`container_spec_memory_limit_bytes`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Memory limit for the container.
 - `container_spec_memory_swap_limit_bytes` (*gauge*)<br>    Memory swap limit for the container.
 - `container_start_time_seconds` (*gauge*)<br>    Start time of the container since unix epoch in seconds.
 - `container_tasks_state` (*gauge*)<br>    Number of tasks in given state

 - `pod_network_receive_packets_total` (*cumulative*)<br>    Cumulative count of packets received. **Note that this metric is not emitted when using the cri-o container runtime.**
 - ***`pod_network_transmit_bytes_total`*** (*cumulative*)<br>    Cumulative count of bytes transmitted. **Note that this metric is not emitted when using the cri-o container runtime.**
 - ***`pod_network_transmit_errors_total`*** (*cumulative*)<br>    Cumulative count of errors encountered while transmitting. **Note that this metric is not emitted when using the cri-o container runtime.**
 - `pod_network_transmit_packets_dropped_total` (*cumulative*)<br>    Cumulative count of packets dropped while transmitting. **Note that this metric is not emitted when using the cri-o container runtime.**
 - `pod_network_transmit_packets_total` (*cumulative*)<br>    Cumulative count of packets transmitted. **Note that this metric is not emitted when using the cri-o container runtime.**

### Non-default metrics (version 4.7.0+)

To emit metrics that are not _default_, you can add those metrics in the
generic monitor-level `extraMetrics` config option.  Metrics that are derived
from specific configuration options that do not appear in the above list of
metrics do not need to be added to `extraMetrics`.

To see a list of metrics that will be emitted you can run `agent-status
monitors` after configuring this monitor in a running agent instance.

## Dimensions

The following dimensions may occur on metrics emitted by this monitor.  Some
dimensions may be specific to certain metrics.

| Name | Description |
| ---  | ---         |
| `container_id` | The ID of the running container |
| `container_image` | The container image name |
| `container_name` | The container's name as it appears in the pod spec, the same as container_spec_name but retained for backwards compatibility. |
| `container_spec_name` | The container's name as it appears in the pod spec |
| `kubernetes_namespace` | The K8s namespace the container is part of |
| `kubernetes_pod_name` | The pod instance under which this container runs |
| `kubernetes_pod_uid` | The UID of the pod instance under which this container runs |
