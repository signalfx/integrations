# collectd/mongodb

Monitor Type: `collectd/mongodb` ([Source](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/pkg/monitors/collectd/mongodb))

**Accepts Endpoints**: **Yes**

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: Yes

## Overview

Monitors an instance of MongoDB using the [collectd MongoDB Python
plugin](https://github.com/signalfx/collectd-mongodb).  Requires MongoDB
2.6 or later.

This monitor captures the following metrics about MongoDB generally:

* memory
* network input/output bytes count
* heap usage
* db connections
* operations count
* active client connections
* queued operations

The plugin also captures the following DB-specific metrics:

* db size
* db counters

Documentation for MongoDB can be found [here](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/).

<!--- SETUP --->
### Creating a MongoDB user for collectd

If you're monitoring a secured MongoDB deployment, it is a good practice to create a MongoDB user with minimal read-only roles, as follows:

```
db.createUser( {
  user: "collectd",
  pwd: "collectd",
  roles: [ { role: "readAnyDatabase", db: "admin" }, { role: "clusterMonitor", db: "admin" } ]
});
```


## Configuration

To activate this monitor in the Smart Agent, add the following to your
agent config:

```
monitors:  # All monitor config goes under this key
 - type: collectd/mongodb
   ...  # Additional config
```

**For a list of monitor options that are common to all monitors, see [Common
Configuration](../monitor-config.html#common-configuration).**


| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `pythonBinary` | no | `string` | Path to a python binary that should be used to execute the Python code. If not set, a built-in runtime will be used.  Can include arguments to the binary as well. |
| `host` | **yes** | `string` | Host name/IP address of the Mongo instance |
| `port` | **yes** | `integer` | Port of the Mongo instance (default: 27017) |
| `databases` | **yes** | `list of strings` | Name(s) of database(s) that you would like metrics from. Note: the first database in this list must be "admin", as it is used to perform a `serverStatus()` command. |
| `username` | no | `string` | The MongoDB user to connect as |
| `password` | no | `string` | The password of the above user |
| `useTLS` | no | `bool` | If true, will connect to Mongo using TLS (**default:** `false`) |
| `caCerts` | no | `string` | Path to a CA cert that will be used to verify the certificate that Mongo presents (not needed if not using TLS or if Mongo's cert is signed by a globally trusted issuer already installed in the default location on your OS) |
| `tlsClientCert` | no | `string` | Path to a client certificate (not needed unless your Mongo instance requires x509 client verification) |
| `tlsClientKey` | no | `string` | Path to a client certificate key (not needed unless your Mongo instance requires x509 client verification, or if your client cert above has the key included) |
| `tlsClientKeyPassPhrase` | no | `string` | Passphrase for the TLSClientKey above |
| `sendCollectionMetrics` | no | `bool` | Whether to send collection level metrics or not (**default:** `false`) |
| `sendCollectionTopMetrics` | no | `bool` | Whether to send collection level top (timing) metrics or not (**default:** `false`) |

### Non-default metrics (version 4.7.0+)

To emit metrics that are not _default_, you can add those metrics in the
generic monitor-level `extraMetrics` config option.  Metrics that are derived
from specific configuration options that do not appear in the above list of
metrics do not need to be added to `extraMetrics`.

To see a list of metrics that will be emitted you can run `agent-status
monitors` after configuring this monitor in a running agent instance.

## Dimensions

The following dimensions may occur on metrics emitted by this monitor.  Some
dimensions may be specific to certain metrics.

| Name | Description |
| ---  | ---         |
| `plugin_instance` | Port number of the MongoDB instance |
