# elasticsearch-query

Monitor Type: `elasticsearch-query` ([Source](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/pkg/monitors/elasticsearch/query))

**Accepts Endpoints**: **Yes**

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: Yes

## Overview

**This monitor is in beta.**

This monitor metricizes aggregated responses from Elasticsearch. The monitor
constructs SignalFx datapoints based on Elasticsearch aggregation types and
also aggregation names.

An simple configuration looks like the following:

```yaml
monitors:
- type: elasticsearch-query
 host: localhost
 port: 9200
 index: <name_of_index>
 elasticsearchRequest: |
    {
      "query" : {
        "range" : {
          "@timestamp" : {
            "gte": "now-5m"
          }
        }
      },
      "aggs": {
        "avg_cpu_utilization": {
          "avg": {
            "field": "cpu_utilization"
          }
        }
      }
    }
intervalSeconds: 300
```

The `elasticsearchRequest` takes in a `string` request in the format specified
[here] (https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-request-body.html).

The above query is performed against an index that has documents that take the following form

```
{
   'cpu_utilization':87,
   'memory_utilization':94,
   'host':'helsniki',
   'service':'android',
   'container_id':'macbook',
   '@timestamp':1580321240579
}
```

The query specified in `elasticsearchRequest` returns the average value of `cpu_utilization` across all documents with a `@timestamp`
in the last five minutes. This value is metricized to the following form in SignalFx :

```
{
metric_name: avg_cpu_utilization,
dimensions:
  index: <name_of_index>
  metric_aggregation_type: avg
}
```

## Data Model Transformation

Read through the following section to understand how this monitor transforms Elasticsearch
responses to SignalFx datapoints.

At high level this monitor metricizes responses of the following types -

1. Metric aggregations inside one or more Bucket aggregations such as the `terms` and `filters`
aggregations. Dimensions on a datapoint are determined by the aggregation name (dimension name)
and the `key` of each bucket (dimension value). The metric name is derived from the type of
Metric aggregation name and it's values in case of multi-value aggregations. A dimension called
`metric_aggregation_type` will also be set on the corresponding datapoints. See below for examples.

2. Metric aggregations applied without any Bucket aggregation will be transformed just like in
the above case.

3. Bucket aggregations that do not have any Metric aggregations as sub aggregations will be
transformed to a metric called `<name_of_aggregation>.doc_count` and will have `bucket_aggregation_name`
dimension apart from the `key` of each bucket.

**Note**: Since Bucket aggregations determine dimensions in SignalFx, in most cases Bucket aggregations
should be performed on `string` fields that represent a slice of the data from Elasticsearch.

## Examples

1. `avg` metric aggregation as a sub aggregation of `terms` bucket aggregation


```json
{
  "aggs":{
    "host" : {
      "terms":{"field" : "host"},
      "aggs": {
        "average_cpu_usage": {
          "avg": {
            "field": "cpu_utilization"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The above query will result in a metric called `elasticsearch_query.average_cpu_usage` and each datapoint
will have a `host` dimension with its value being the `key` of a bucket in the response. The type of the
metric aggregation (`avg`) will be set on the datapoint as `metric_aggregation_type` dimension. If the response
looked like the below json, 4 datapoints would be collected, each with a different value for `host`.

```json
...
"aggregations" : {
  "host" : {
    "doc_count_error_upper_bound" : 0,
    "sum_other_doc_count" : 0,
    "buckets" : [
      {
        "key" : "helsniki",
        "doc_count" : 13802,
        "average_cpu_usage" : {
          "value" : 49.77438052456166
        }
      },
      {
        "key" : "lisbon",
        "doc_count" : 13802,
        "average_cpu_usage" : {
          "value" : 49.919866685987536
        }
      },
      {
        "key" : "madrid",
        "doc_count" : 13802,
        "average_cpu_usage" : {
          "value" : 49.878350963628456
        }
      },
      {
        "key" : "nairobi",
        "doc_count" : 13802,
        "average_cpu_usage" : {
          "value" : 49.99789885523837
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
...
```

2. `extended_stats` metric aggregation as a sub aggregation of `terms` bucket aggregation


```json
{
 "aggs":{
   "host" : {
     "terms":{"field" : "host"},
     "aggs": {
       "cpu_usage_stats": {
         "extended_stats": {
           "field": "cpu_utilization"
         }
       }
     }
   }
 }
}
```

```json
...
"aggregations" : {
  "host" : {
    "doc_count_error_upper_bound" : 0,
    "sum_other_doc_count" : 0,
    "buckets" : [
      {
        "key" : "helsniki",
        "doc_count" : 13996,
        "cpu_usage_stats" : {
          "count" : 13996,
          "min" : 0.0,
          "max" : 100.0,
          "avg" : 49.86660474421263,
          "sum" : 697933.0
        }
      },
      {
        "key" : "lisbon",
        "doc_count" : 13996,
        "cpu_usage_stats" : {
          "count" : 13996,
          "min" : 0.0,
          "max" : 100.0,
          "avg" : 49.88225207202058,
          "sum" : 698152.0
        }
      },
      {
        "key" : "madrid",
        "doc_count" : 13996,
        "cpu_usage_stats" : {
          "count" : 13996,
          "min" : 0.0,
          "max" : 100.0,
          "avg" : 49.92469276936267,
          "sum" : 698746.0
        }
      },
      {
        "key" : "nairobi",
        "doc_count" : 13996,
        "cpu_usage_stats" : {
          "count" : 13996,
          "min" : 0.0,
          "max" : 100.0,
          "avg" : 49.98320948842527,
          "sum" : 699565.0
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
...
```

In this case, each bucket will result 5 metrics -

  1. `cpu_usage_stats.count`
  2. `cpu_usage_stats.min`
  3. `cpu_usage_stats.max`
  4. `cpu_usage_stats.avg`
  5. `cpu_usage_stats.sum`

The dimensions are derived in the same manner as the previous example.

The agent does not do any built-in filtering of metrics coming out of this
monitor.
