# kubernetes-volumes

Monitor Type: `kubernetes-volumes` ([Source](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/internal/monitors/kubernetes/volumes))

**Accepts Endpoints**: No

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: Yes

## Overview

This monitor sends usage stats about volumes
mounted to Kubernetes pods (e.g. free space/inodes).  This information is
gotten from the Kubelet /stats/summary endpoint.  The normal `collectd/df`
monitor generally will not report Persistent Volume usage metrics because
those volumes are not seen by the agent since they can be mounted
dynamically and older versions of K8s don't support mount propagation of
those mounts to the agent container.

Dimensions that identify the underlying volume source will be added for
`awsElasticBlockStore` and `glusterfs` volumes.  Support for more can be
easily added as needed.


## Configuration

To activate this monitor in the Smart Agent, add the following to your
agent config:

```
monitors:  # All monitor config goes under this key
 - type: kubernetes-volumes
   ...  # Additional config
```

**For a list of monitor options that are common to all monitors, see [Common
Configuration](../monitor-config.html#common-configuration).**


| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `kubeletAPI` | no | `object (see below)` | Kubelet kubeletClient configuration |
| `kubernetesAPI` | no | `object (see below)` | Configuration of the Kubernetes API kubeletClient |


The **nested** `kubeletAPI` config object has the following fields:

| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `url` | no | `string` | URL of the Kubelet instance.  This will default to `https://<current node hostname>:10250` if not provided. |
| `authType` | no | `string` | Can be `none` for no auth, `tls` for TLS client cert auth, or `serviceAccount` to use the pod's default service account token to authenticate. (**default:** `none`) |
| `skipVerify` | no | `bool` | Whether to skip verification of the Kubelet's TLS cert (**default:** `true`) |
| `caCertPath` | no | `string` | Path to the CA cert that has signed the Kubelet's TLS cert, unnecessary if `skipVerify` is set to false. |
| `clientCertPath` | no | `string` | Path to the client TLS cert to use if `authType` is set to `tls` |
| `clientKeyPath` | no | `string` | Path to the client TLS key to use if `authType` is set to `tls` |
| `logResponses` | no | `bool` | Whether to log the raw cadvisor response at the debug level for debugging purposes. (**default:** `false`) |


The **nested** `kubernetesAPI` config object has the following fields:

| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `authType` | no | `string` | How to authenticate to the K8s API server.  This can be one of `none` (for no auth), `tls` (to use manually specified TLS client certs, not recommended), `serviceAccount` (to use the standard service account token provided to the agent pod), or `kubeConfig` to use credentials from `~/.kube/config`. (**default:** `serviceAccount`) |
| `skipVerify` | no | `bool` | Whether to skip verifying the TLS cert from the API server.  Almost never needed. (**default:** `false`) |
| `clientCertPath` | no | `string` | The path to the TLS client cert on the pod's filesystem, if using `tls` auth. |
| `clientKeyPath` | no | `string` | The path to the TLS client key on the pod's filesystem, if using `tls` auth. |
| `caCertPath` | no | `string` | Path to a CA certificate to use when verifying the API server's TLS cert.  Generally this is provided by K8s alongside the service account token, which will be picked up automatically, so this should rarely be necessary to specify. |


## Metrics

These are the metrics available for this monitor.
This monitor emits all metrics by default; however, **none are categorized as
[container/host](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/admin-guide/usage.html#about-custom-bundled-and-high-resolution-metrics)
-- they are all custom**.



 - ***`kubernetes.volume_available_bytes`*** (*gauge*)<br>    The number of available bytes in the volume
 - ***`kubernetes.volume_capacity_bytes`*** (*gauge*)<br>    The total capacity in bytes of the volume
The agent does not do any built-in filtering of metrics coming out of this
monitor.
## Dimensions

The following dimensions may occur on metrics emitted by this monitor.  Some
dimensions may be specific to certain metrics.

| Name | Description |
| ---  | ---         |
| `VolumeId` | (*EBS volumes only*) The EBS volume id of the underlying volume source |
| `endpoints_name` | (*GlusterFS volumes only*) The endpoint name used for the GlusterFS volume |
| `glusterfs_path` | (*GlusterFS volumes only*) The GlusterFS volume path |
| `kubernetes_namespace` | The namespace of the pod that has this volume |
| `kubernetes_pod_name` | The name of the pod that has this volume |
| `kubernetes_pod_uid` | The UID of the pod that has this volume |
| `partition` | (*EBS volumes only*) The partition number of the underlying EBS volume (`0` indicates the entire disk) |
| `volume` | The volume name as given in the pod spec under `volumes` |
| `volume_type` | The type of the underlying volume -- this will be the key used in the k8s volume config spec (e.g. awsElasticBlockStore, etc.) |
