# kubernetes-volumes

Monitor Type: `kubernetes-volumes` ([Source](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/main/pkg/monitors/kubernetes/volumes))

**Accepts Endpoints**: No

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: Yes

## Overview

This monitor sends usage stats about volumes
mounted to Kubernetes pods (e.g. free space/inodes).  This information is
gotten from the Kubelet /stats/summary endpoint.  The normal `filesystems`
monitor generally will not report Persistent Volume usage metrics because
those volumes are not seen by the agent since they can be mounted
dynamically and older versions of K8s don't support mount propagation of
those mounts to the agent container.

Dimensions that identify the underlying volume source will be added for
`awsElasticBlockStore`, `gcePersistentDisk` and `glusterfs` persistent
volumes, and for `configMap`, `downwardAPI`, `emptyDir` and `secret`
non-persistent volumes. Support for more can be easily added as needed.

If interested in collecting metrics from Persistent Volumes and Persistent
Volume Claims from a RBAC enabled cluster the following permissions need to
be granted to the Agent.

```yaml
- apiGroups:
    - ""
  resources:
    - persistentvolumes
    - persistentvolumeclaims
  verbs:
    - get
```


## Configuration

To activate this monitor in the Smart Agent, add the following to your
agent config:

```
monitors:  # All monitor config goes under this key
 - type: kubernetes-volumes
   ...  # Additional config
```

**For a list of monitor options that are common to all monitors, see [Common
Configuration](../monitor-config.html#common-configuration).**


| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `kubeletAPI` | no | `object (see below)` | Kubelet kubeletClient configuration |
| `kubernetesAPI` | no | `object (see below)` | Configuration of the Kubernetes API kubeletClient |


The **nested** `kubeletAPI` config object has the following fields:

| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `url` | no | `string` | URL of the Kubelet instance.  This will default to `http://<current node hostname>:10255` if not provided. |
| `authType` | no | `string` | Can be `none` for no auth, `tls` for TLS client cert auth, or `serviceAccount` to use the pod's default service account token to authenticate. (**default:** `none`) |
| `skipVerify` | no | `bool` | Whether to skip verification of the Kubelet's TLS cert (**default:** `true`) |
| `caCertPath` | no | `string` | Path to the CA cert that has signed the Kubelet's TLS cert, unnecessary if `skipVerify` is set to false. |
| `clientCertPath` | no | `string` | Path to the client TLS cert to use if `authType` is set to `tls` |
| `clientKeyPath` | no | `string` | Path to the client TLS key to use if `authType` is set to `tls` |
| `logResponses` | no | `bool` | Whether to log the raw cadvisor response at the debug level for debugging purposes. (**default:** `false`) |


The **nested** `kubernetesAPI` config object has the following fields:

| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `authType` | no | `string` | How to authenticate to the K8s API server.  This can be one of `none` (for no auth), `tls` (to use manually specified TLS client certs, not recommended), `serviceAccount` (to use the standard service account token provided to the agent pod), or `kubeConfig` to use credentials from `~/.kube/config`. (**default:** `serviceAccount`) |
| `skipVerify` | no | `bool` | Whether to skip verifying the TLS cert from the API server.  Almost never needed. (**default:** `false`) |
| `clientCertPath` | no | `string` | The path to the TLS client cert on the pod's filesystem, if using `tls` auth. |
| `clientKeyPath` | no | `string` | The path to the TLS client key on the pod's filesystem, if using `tls` auth. |
| `caCertPath` | no | `string` | Path to a CA certificate to use when verifying the API server's TLS cert.  Generally this is provided by K8s alongside the service account token, which will be picked up automatically, so this should rarely be necessary to specify. |


## Metrics

These are the metrics available for this monitor.
Metrics that are categorized as
[container/host](https://docs.splunk.com/Observability/admin/subscription-usage/monitor-imm-billing-usage.html#about-custom-bundled-and-high-resolution-metrics)
(*default*) are ***in bold and italics*** in the list below.


 - ***`kubernetes.volume_available_bytes`*** (*gauge*)<br>    The number of available bytes in the volume
 - ***`kubernetes.volume_capacity_bytes`*** (*gauge*)<br>    The total capacity in bytes of the volume
 - `kubernetes.volume_inodes` (*gauge*)<br>    The total inodes in the filesystem
 - `kubernetes.volume_inodes_free` (*gauge*)<br>    The free inodes in the filesystem
 - `kubernetes.volume_inodes_used` (*gauge*)<br>    The inodes used by the filesystem. This may not equal `inodes - free` because filesystem may share inodes with other filesystems.

### Non-default metrics (version 4.7.0+)

To emit metrics that are not _default_, you can add those metrics in the
generic monitor-level `extraMetrics` config option.  Metrics that are derived
from specific configuration options that do not appear in the above list of
metrics do not need to be added to `extraMetrics`.

To see a list of metrics that will be emitted you can run `agent-status
monitors` after configuring this monitor in a running agent instance.

## Dimensions

The following dimensions may occur on metrics emitted by this monitor.  Some
dimensions may be specific to certain metrics.

| Name | Description |
| ---  | ---         |
| `VolumeId` | (*EBS volumes only*) The EBS volume id of the underlying volume source |
| `endpoints_name` | (*GlusterFS volumes only*) The endpoint name used for the GlusterFS volume |
| `fs_type` | (*EBS volumes and GCE persistent disks only*) The filesystem type of the underlying EBS volume or GCE persistent disk |
| `glusterfs_path` | (*GlusterFS volumes only*) The GlusterFS volume path |
| `kubernetes_namespace` | The namespace of the pod that has this volume |
| `kubernetes_pod_name` | The name of the pod that has this volume |
| `kubernetes_pod_uid` | The UID of the pod that has this volume |
| `partition` | (*EBS volumes and GCE persistent disks only*) The partition number of the underlying EBS volume or GCE persistent disk (`0` indicates the entire disk) |
| `pd_name` | (*GCE persistent disks only*) The GCE persistent disk name of the underlying volume source |
| `volume` | The volume name as given in the pod spec under `volumes` |
| `volume_type` | The type of the underlying volume -- this will be the key used in the k8s volume config spec (e.g. `awsElasticBlockStore`, `gcePersistentDisk`, `configMap`, `secret`, etc.) |
