# signalfx-forwarder

Monitor Type: `signalfx-forwarder` ([Source](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/pkg/monitors/forwarder))

**Accepts Endpoints**: No

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: **No**

## Overview

Runs an HTTP server that listens for SignalFx datapoints and trace spans
and forwards them to SignalFx (or the configured ingest host in the
`writer` section of the agent config).  This supports the latest formats
for datapoints (v2) and spans (v1) that our ingest server supports and at
the same path (`/v2/datapoint`, `/v1/trace`).  By default, the server listens on
localhost port 9080 but can be configured to anything.


## Configuration

To activate this monitor in the Smart Agent, add the following to your
agent config:

```
monitors:  # All monitor config goes under this key
 - type: signalfx-forwarder
   ...  # Additional config
```

**For a list of monitor options that are common to all monitors, see [Common
Configuration](../monitor-config.html#common-configuration).**


| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `listenAddress` | no | `string` | The host:port on which to listen for datapoints.  The listening server accepts datapoints on the same HTTP path that ingest/gateway accepts them (e.g. `/v2/datapoint`, `/v1/trace`).  Requests to other paths will return 404s. (**default:** `127.0.0.1:9080`) |
| `serverTimeout` | no | `int64` | HTTP timeout duration for both read and writes. This should be a duration string that is accepted by https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration (**default:** `5s`) |
| `sendInternalMetrics` | no | `bool` | Whether to emit internal metrics about the HTTP listener (**default:** `false`) |
