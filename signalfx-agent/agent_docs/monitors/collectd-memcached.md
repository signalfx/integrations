# collectd/memcached

Monitor Type: `collectd/memcached` ([Source](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/main/pkg/monitors/collectd/memcached))

**Accepts Endpoints**: **Yes**

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: Yes

## Overview

Monitors an instance of memcached using the [collectd memcached
plugin](https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:memcached).  Requires
Memcached 1.1 or later.

The monitor collects the following information from Memcached nodes:

* request information (including hits, misses & evictions)
* current connections
* net input/output bytes
* number of items cached

Documentation for Memcached can be found at https://github.com/memcached/memcached/wiki.


## Configuration

To activate this monitor in the Smart Agent, add the following to your
agent config:

```
monitors:  # All monitor config goes under this key
 - type: collectd/memcached
   ...  # Additional config
```

**For a list of monitor options that are common to all monitors, see [Common
Configuration](../monitor-config.html#common-configuration).**


| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `host` | **yes** | `string` |  |
| `port` | **yes** | `integer` |  |
| `name` | no | `string` |  |
| `reportHost` | no | `bool` |  (**default:** `false`) |

### Non-default metrics (version 4.7.0+)

To emit metrics that are not _default_, you can add those metrics in the
generic monitor-level `extraMetrics` config option.  Metrics that are derived
from specific configuration options that do not appear in the above list of
metrics do not need to be added to `extraMetrics`.

To see a list of metrics that will be emitted you can run `agent-status
monitors` after configuring this monitor in a running agent instance.
