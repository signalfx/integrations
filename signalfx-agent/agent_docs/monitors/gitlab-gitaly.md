# gitlab-gitaly

Monitor Type: `gitlab-gitaly` ([Source](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/main/pkg/monitors/gitlab))

**Accepts Endpoints**: **Yes**

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: Yes

## Overview

This monitor scrapes the [Gitlab Gitaly GRPC server](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/gitaly/).  See the [Gitlab monitor](gitlab.md) for more information.


## Configuration

To activate this monitor in the Smart Agent, add the following to your
agent config:

```
monitors:  # All monitor config goes under this key
 - type: gitlab-gitaly
   ...  # Additional config
```

**For a list of monitor options that are common to all monitors, see [Common
Configuration](../monitor-config.html#common-configuration).**


| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `httpTimeout` | no | `int64` | HTTP timeout duration for both read and writes. This should be a duration string that is accepted by https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration (**default:** `10s`) |
| `username` | no | `string` | Basic Auth username to use on each request, if any. |
| `password` | no | `string` | Basic Auth password to use on each request, if any. |
| `useHTTPS` | no | `bool` | If true, the agent will connect to the server using HTTPS instead of plain HTTP. (**default:** `false`) |
| `httpHeaders` | no | `map of strings` | A map of HTTP header names to values. Comma separated multiple values for the same message-header is supported. |
| `skipVerify` | no | `bool` | If useHTTPS is true and this option is also true, the exporter's TLS cert will not be verified. (**default:** `false`) |
| `sniServerName` | no | `string` | If useHTTPS is true and skipVerify is true, the sniServerName is used to verify the hostname on the returned certificates. It is also included in the client's handshake to support virtual hosting unless it is an IP address. |
| `caCertPath` | no | `string` | Path to the CA cert that has signed the TLS cert, unnecessary if `skipVerify` is set to false. |
| `clientCertPath` | no | `string` | Path to the client TLS cert to use for TLS required connections |
| `clientKeyPath` | no | `string` | Path to the client TLS key to use for TLS required connections |
| `host` | **yes** | `string` | Host of the exporter |
| `port` | **yes** | `integer` | Port of the exporter |
| `useServiceAccount` | no | `bool` | Use pod service account to authenticate. (**default:** `false`) |
| `metricPath` | no | `string` | Path to the metrics endpoint on the exporter server, usually `/metrics` (the default). (**default:** `/metrics`) |
| `sendAllMetrics` | no | `bool` | Send all the metrics that come out of the Prometheus exporter without any filtering.  This option has no effect when using the prometheus exporter monitor directly since there is no built-in filtering, only when embedding it in other monitors. (**default:** `false`) |


## Metrics

These are the metrics available for this monitor.
Metrics that are categorized as
[container/host](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/admin-guide/usage.html#about-custom-bundled-and-high-resolution-metrics)
(*default*) are ***in bold and italics*** in the list below.


 - `gitaly_authentications` (*cumulative*)<br>    Counts of of Gitaly request authentication attempts
 - `gitaly_connections_total` (*cumulative*)<br>    Total number of connections accepted by this Gitaly process
 - `gitaly_service_client_requests` (*cumulative*)<br>    Counter of client requests received by client, call_site, auth version, and response code
 - `gitaly_smarthttp_deepen_count` (*cumulative*)<br>    Number of git-upload-pack requests processed that contained a 'deepen' message
 - `gitaly_spawn_timeout_count` (*cumulative*)<br>    Number of process spawn timeouts
 - ***`gitaly_supervisor_health_checks`*** (*cumulative*)<br>    Count of Gitaly supervisor health checks
 - `gitaly_supervisor_rss_bytes` (*gauge*)<br>    Resident set size of supervised processes, in bytes
 - `gitaly_supervisor_starts_total` (*cumulative*)<br>    Number of starts of supervised processes
 - `gitlab_build_info` (*gauge*)<br>    Current build info for this GitLab Service
 - ***`grpc_server_handled_total`*** (*cumulative*)<br>    Total number of RPCs completed on the server, regardless of success or failure
 - `grpc_server_msg_received_total` (*cumulative*)<br>    Total number of RPC stream messages received on the server
 - `grpc_server_msg_sent_total` (*cumulative*)<br>    Total number of gRPC stream messages sent by the server
 - `grpc_server_started_total` (*cumulative*)<br>    Total number of RPCs started on the server

### Non-default metrics (version 4.7.0+)

To emit metrics that are not _default_, you can add those metrics in the
generic monitor-level `extraMetrics` config option.  Metrics that are derived
from specific configuration options that do not appear in the above list of
metrics do not need to be added to `extraMetrics`.

To see a list of metrics that will be emitted you can run `agent-status
monitors` after configuring this monitor in a running agent instance.
