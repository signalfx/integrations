# trace-forwarder

Monitor Type: `trace-forwarder` ([Source](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/internal/monitors/traceforwarder))

**Accepts Endpoints**: No

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: **No**

## Overview

Runs an HTTP server that listens for trace spans
and forwards them to SignalFx (or the configured ingest host in the `writer`
section of the agent config).  This supports the same span formats that our
ingest server supports and at the same path (`/v1/trace`).  By default, the
server listens on localhost port 9080 but can be configured to anything.


## Configuration

To activate this monitor in the Smart Agent, add the following to your
agent config:

```
monitors:  # All monitor config goes under this key
 - type: trace-forwarder
   ...  # Additional config
```

**For a list of monitor options that are common to all monitors, see [Common
Configuration](../monitor-config.html#common-configuration).**


| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `listenAddress` | no | `string` | The host:port on which to listen for spans.  This server accepts spans in all of the formats that we support on our regular ingest server.  The listening server accepts spans on the same HTTP path that ingest accepts them (e.g. `/v1/trace`).  Requests to other paths will return 404s. (**default:** `127.0.0.1:9080`) |
| `serverTimeout` | no | `int64` | HTTP timeout duration for both read and writes. This should be a duration string that is accepted by https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration (**default:** `5s`) |
| `sendInternalMetrics` | no | `bool` | Whether to send internal metrics about the HTTP listener (**default:** `false`) |
