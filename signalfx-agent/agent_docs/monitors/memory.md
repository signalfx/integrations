# memory

Monitor Type: `memory` ([Source](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/main/pkg/monitors/memory))

**Accepts Endpoints**: No

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: **No**

## Overview

This monitor reports memory and memory utilization metrics.

On Linux hosts, this monitor relies on the `/proc` filesystem.
If the underlying host's `/proc` file system is mounted somewhere other than
/proc please specify the path using the top level configuration `procPath`.

```yaml
procPath: /proc
monitors:
 - type: memory
```


## Configuration

To activate this monitor in the Smart Agent, add the following to your
agent config:

```
monitors:  # All monitor config goes under this key
 - type: memory
   ...  # Additional config
```

**For a list of monitor options that are common to all monitors, see [Common
Configuration](../monitor-config.html#common-configuration).**


This monitor has no configuration options.
## Metrics

These are the metrics available for this monitor.
Metrics that are categorized as
[container/host](https://docs.splunk.com/Observability/admin/subscription-usage/monitor-imm-billing-usage.html#about-custom-bundled-and-high-resolution-metrics)
(*default*) are ***in bold and italics*** in the list below.


 - `memory.available` (*gauge*)<br>    (Windows Only) Bytes of memory available for use.
 - ***`memory.buffered`*** (*gauge*)<br>    (Linux Only) Bytes of memory used for buffering I/O.
 - ***`memory.cached`*** (*gauge*)<br>    (Linux Only) Bytes of memory used for disk caching.
 - ***`memory.free`*** (*gauge*)<br>    (Linux Only) Bytes of memory available for use.
 - ***`memory.slab_recl`*** (*gauge*)<br>    (Linux Only) Bytes of memory, used for SLAB-allocation of kernel objects, that can be reclaimed.
 - ***`memory.slab_unrecl`*** (*gauge*)<br>    (Linux Only) Bytes of memory, used for SLAB-allocation of kernel objects, that can't be reclaimed.
 - `memory.swap_free` (*gauge*)<br>    Bytes of swap memory available for use.
 - `memory.swap_total` (*gauge*)<br>    Total bytes of swap memory on the system.
 - `memory.swap_used` (*gauge*)<br>    Bytes of swap memory in use by the system.
 - ***`memory.total`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Total bytes of system memory on the system.
 - ***`memory.used`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Bytes of memory in use by the system.
 - ***`memory.utilization`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Percent of memory in use on this host.  This does NOT include buffer or cache memory on Linux.

### Non-default metrics (version 4.7.0+)

To emit metrics that are not _default_, you can add those metrics in the
generic monitor-level `extraMetrics` config option.  Metrics that are derived
from specific configuration options that do not appear in the above list of
metrics do not need to be added to `extraMetrics`.

To see a list of metrics that will be emitted you can run `agent-status
monitors` after configuring this monitor in a running agent instance.
