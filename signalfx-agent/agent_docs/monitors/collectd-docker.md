# collectd/docker

Monitor Type: `collectd/docker` ([Source](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/internal/monitors/collectd/docker))

**Accepts Endpoints**: No

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: Yes

## Overview

Pulls container stats from the Docker Engine.  We
strongly recommend using the
[docker-container-stats](./docker-container-stats.md) monitor instead, as it
will scale to large number of containers much better.

See https://github.com/signalfx/docker-collectd-plugin.


## Configuration

To activate this monitor in the Smart Agent, add the following to your
agent config:

```
monitors:  # All monitor config goes under this key
 - type: collectd/docker
   ...  # Additional config
```

**For a list of monitor options that are common to all monitors, see [Common
Configuration](../monitor-config.html#common-configuration).**


| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `dimensions` | no | `map of strings` | A set of dimensions to add to container metrics (see https://github.com/signalfx/docker-collectd-plugin#extracting-additional-dimensions). |
| `dockerURL` | **yes** | `string` | URL of the Docker engine, can be a unix socket path. |
| `excludedImages` | no | `list of strings` | A list of images to exclude from monitoring |
| `excludedNames` | no | `list of strings` | A list of container names to exclude from monitoring |
| `excludedLabels` | no | `map of strings` | A map of label keys/values that will cause a container to be ignored. |
| `collectNetworkStats` | no | `bool` | If true, will collect network stats about a container (will not work in some environments like Kubernetes). (**default:** `false`) |


## Metrics

These are the metrics available for this monitor.
Metrics that are categorized as
[container/host](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/admin-guide/usage.html#about-custom-bundled-and-high-resolution-metrics)
(*default*) are ***in bold and italics*** in the list below.


#### Group blkio
All of the following metrics are part of the `blkio` metric group. All of
the non-default metrics below can be turned on by adding `blkio` to the
monitor config option `extraGroups`:
 - ***`blkio.io_service_bytes_recursive.async`*** (*cumulative*)<br>    Volume, in bytes, of asynchronous block I/O
 - ***`blkio.io_service_bytes_recursive.read`*** (*cumulative*)<br>    Volume, in bytes, of reads from block devices
 - ***`blkio.io_service_bytes_recursive.sync`*** (*cumulative*)<br>    Volume, in bytes, of synchronous block I/O
 - ***`blkio.io_service_bytes_recursive.total`*** (*cumulative*)<br>    Total volume, in bytes, of all block I/O
 - ***`blkio.io_service_bytes_recursive.write`*** (*cumulative*)<br>    Volume, in bytes, of writes to block devices

#### Group cpu
All of the following metrics are part of the `cpu` metric group. All of
the non-default metrics below can be turned on by adding `cpu` to the
monitor config option `extraGroups`:
 - ***`cpu.usage.kernelmode`*** (*cumulative*)<br>    Jiffies of CPU time spent in kernel mode by the container
 - ***`cpu.usage.system`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Jiffies of CPU time used by the system
 - ***`cpu.usage.total`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Jiffies of CPU time used by the container
 - ***`cpu.usage.usermode`*** (*cumulative*)<br>    Jiffies of CPU time spent in user mode by the container

#### Group memory
All of the following metrics are part of the `memory` metric group. All of
the non-default metrics below can be turned on by adding `memory` to the
monitor config option `extraGroups`:
 - ***`memory.usage.limit`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Memory usage limit of the container, in bytes
 - ***`memory.usage.max`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Maximum measured memory usage of the container, in bytes
 - ***`memory.usage.total`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Bytes of memory used by the container

#### Group network
All of the following metrics are part of the `network` metric group. All of
the non-default metrics below can be turned on by adding `network` to the
monitor config option `extraGroups`:
 - `network.usage.rx_bytes` (*cumulative*)<br>    Bytes received by the container via its network interface
 - `network.usage.rx_dropped` (*cumulative*)<br>    Number of inbound network packets dropped by the container
 - `network.usage.rx_errors` (*cumulative*)<br>    Errors receiving network packets
 - `network.usage.rx_packets` (*cumulative*)<br>    Network packets received by the container via its network interface
 - `network.usage.tx_bytes` (*cumulative*)<br>    Bytes sent by the container via its network interface
 - `network.usage.tx_dropped` (*cumulative*)<br>    Number of outbound network packets dropped by the container
 - `network.usage.tx_errors` (*cumulative*)<br>    Errors sending network packets
 - `network.usage.tx_packets` (*cumulative*)<br>    Network packets sent by the container via its network interface

### Non-default metrics (version 4.7.0+)

**The following information applies to the agent version 4.7.0+ that has
`enableBuiltInFiltering: true` set on the top level of the agent config.**

To emit metrics that are not _default_, you can add those metrics in the
generic monitor-level `extraMetrics` config option.  Metrics that are derived
from specific configuration options that do not appear in the above list of
metrics do not need to be added to `extraMetrics`.

To see a list of metrics that will be emitted you can run `agent-status
monitors` after configuring this monitor in a running agent instance.

### Legacy non-default metrics (version < 4.7.0)

**The following information only applies to agent version older than 4.7.0. If
you have a newer agent and have set `enableBuiltInFiltering: true` at the top
level of your agent config, see the section above. See upgrade instructions in
[Old-style whitelist filtering](../legacy-filtering.html#old-style-whitelist-filtering).**

If you have a reference to the `whitelist.json` in your agent's top-level
`metricsToExclude` config option, and you want to emit metrics that are not in
that whitelist, then you need to add an item to the top-level
`metricsToInclude` config option to override that whitelist (see [Inclusion
filtering](../legacy-filtering.html#inclusion-filtering).  Or you can just
copy the whitelist.json, modify it, and reference that in `metricsToExclude`.
