# collectd/marathon

Monitor Type: `collectd/marathon` ([Source](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/pkg/monitors/collectd/marathon))

**Accepts Endpoints**: **Yes**

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: **No**

## Overview

Monitors a Mesos Marathon instance using the
[collectd Marathon Python plugin](https://github.com/signalfx/collectd-marathon).

See the [integrations
doc](https://docs.splunk.com/observability/gdi/marathon/marathon.html)
for more information on configuration.

Sample YAML configuration:

```yaml
monitors:
  - type: collectd/marathon
    host: 127.0.0.1
    port: 8080
    scheme: http
```

Sample YAML configuration for DC/OS:

```yaml
monitors:
  - type: collectd/marathon
    host: 127.0.0.1
    port: 8080
    scheme: https
    dcosAuthURL: https://leader.mesos/acs/api/v1/auth/login
```


## Configuration

To activate this monitor in the Smart Agent, add the following to your
agent config:

```
monitors:  # All monitor config goes under this key
 - type: collectd/marathon
   ...  # Additional config
```

**For a list of monitor options that are common to all monitors, see [Common
Configuration](../monitor-config.html#common-configuration).**


| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `pythonBinary` | no | `string` | Path to a python binary that should be used to execute the Python code. If not set, a built-in runtime will be used.  Can include arguments to the binary as well. |
| `host` | **yes** | `string` |  |
| `port` | **yes** | `integer` |  |
| `username` | no | `string` | Username used to authenticate with Marathon. |
| `password` | no | `string` | Password used to authenticate with Marathon. |
| `scheme` | no | `string` | Set to either `http` or `https`. (**default:** `http`) |
| `dcosAuthURL` | no | `string` | The dcos authentication URL which the plugin uses to get authentication tokens from. Set scheme to "https" if operating DC/OS in strict mode and dcosAuthURL to "https://leader.mesos/acs/api/v1/auth/login" (which is the default DNS entry provided by DC/OS) |


## Metrics

These are the metrics available for this monitor.
This monitor emits all metrics by default; however, **none are categorized as
[container/host](https://docs.splunk.com/observability/admin/subscription-usage/monitor-imm-billing-usage.html#about-custom-bundled-and-high-resolution-metrics)
-- they are all custom**.


 - ***`gauge.marathon.app.cpu.allocated`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Number of CPUs allocated to an application
 - ***`gauge.marathon.app.cpu.allocated.per.instance`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Configured number of CPUs allocated to each application instance
 - `gauge.marathon.app.delayed` (*gauge*)<br>    Indicates if the application is delayed or not
 - `gauge.marathon.app.deployments.total` (*gauge*)<br>    Number of application deployments
 - ***`gauge.marathon.app.disk.allocated`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Storage allocated to a Marathon application
 - ***`gauge.marathon.app.disk.allocated.per.instance`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Configured storage allocated each to application instance
 - `gauge.marathon.app.gpu.allocated` (*gauge*)<br>    GPU Allocated to a Marathon application
 - `gauge.marathon.app.gpu.allocated.per.instance` (*gauge*)<br>    Configured number of GPUs allocated to each application instance
 - ***`gauge.marathon.app.instances.total`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Number of application instances
 - ***`gauge.marathon.app.memory.allocated`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Memory Allocated to a Marathon application

 - ***`gauge.marathon.task.healthchecks.failing.total`*** (*gauge*)<br>    The number of failing health checks for a task
 - ***`gauge.marathon.task.healthchecks.passing.total`*** (*gauge*)<br>    The number of passing health checks for a task
 - `gauge.marathon.task.staged.time.elapsed` (*gauge*)<br>    The amount of time the task spent in staging
 - `gauge.marathon.task.start.time.elapsed` (*gauge*)<br>    Time elapsed since the task started

### Non-default metrics (version 4.7.0+)

**The following information applies to the agent version 4.7.0+ that has
`enableBuiltInFiltering: true` set on the top level of the agent config.**

To emit metrics that are not _default_, you can add those metrics in the
generic monitor-level `extraMetrics` config option.  Metrics that are derived
from specific configuration options that do not appear in the above list of
metrics do not need to be added to `extraMetrics`.

To see a list of metrics that will be emitted you can run `agent-status
monitors` after configuring this monitor in a running agent instance.

### Legacy non-default metrics (version < 4.7.0)

**The following information only applies to agent version older than 4.7.0. If
you have a newer agent and have set `enableBuiltInFiltering: true` at the top
level of your agent config, see the section above. See upgrade instructions in
[Old-style whitelist filtering](../legacy-filtering.html#old-style-whitelist-filtering).**

If you have a reference to the `whitelist.json` in your agent's top-level
`metricsToExclude` config option, and you want to emit metrics that are not in
that whitelist, then you need to add an item to the top-level
`metricsToInclude` config option to override that whitelist (see [Inclusion
filtering](../legacy-filtering.html#inclusion-filtering).  Or you can just
copy the whitelist.json, modify it, and reference that in `metricsToExclude`.
