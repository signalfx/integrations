# collectd/custom

Monitor Type: `collectd/custom` ([Source](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/internal/monitors/collectd/custom))

**Accepts Endpoints**: **Yes**

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: Yes

## Overview

This monitor lets you provide custom collectd
configuration to be run by the managed collectd instance.  You can provide
configuration for as many plugins as you want in a single instance of this
monitor configuration by either putting multiple `<Plugin>` blocks in a
single `template` option, or specifying multiple `templates`.

Note that a distinct instance of collectd is run for each instance of this
monitor, so it is more efficient to group plugin configurations into a
single monitor configuration (either in one big `template` text blob, or
split into multiple `templates`).  You should not group configurations if
using a discoveryRule since that would result in duplicate config for each
instance of the service endpoint discovered.

You can also use your own Python plugins in conjunction with the
`ModulePath` option in
[collectd-python](https://collectd.org/documentation/manpages/collectd-python.5.shtml).
If your Python plugin has dependencies of its own, you can specify the path
to them by specifying multiple `ModulePath` options with those paths.

Here is an example of a configuration with a custom Python plugin:

```yaml
  - type: collectd/custom
    discoveryRule: container_image =~ "myservice"
    template: |
      LoadPlugin "python"
      <Plugin python>
        ModulePath "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/health_checker"
        Import "health_checker"
        <Module health_checker>
          URL "http://{{.Host}}:{{.Port}}"
          JSONKey "isRunning"
          JSONVal "1"
        </Module>
      </Plugin>
```

We have many collectd plugins included in the image that are not exposed as
monitors.  You can see the plugins in the `<AGENT_BUNDLE>/lib/collectd`
directory, where `<AGENT_BUNDLE>` is the root of the filesystem in the
containerized version, and is normally `/usr/lib/signalfx-agent` in the
non-containerized agent.

## Running the collectd/exec plugin
You can use the collectd/custom monitor to run the collectd/exec plugin.
If you are not running the Smart Agent in the container, you can use any appropriate user
on your system.
If you are running the Smart Agent in a container, 
then you can use the 'signalfx-agent' user when you run your script:

```yaml
  - type: collectd/custom
    template: |
      LoadPlugin exec
      <Plugin exec>
        Exec "signalfx-agent" "/path/to/script.sh"
      </Plugin>
```
To learn how to use the collectd/exec plugin, see [the collectd-exec](https://collectd.org/documentation/manpages/collectd.conf.5.shtml#plugin_exec)
documentation.


## Configuration

To activate this monitor in the Smart Agent, add the following to your
agent config:

```
monitors:  # All monitor config goes under this key
 - type: collectd/custom
   ...  # Additional config
```

**For a list of monitor options that are common to all monitors, see [Common
Configuration](../monitor-config.html#common-configuration).**


| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `host` | no | `string` | This should generally not be set manually, but will be filled in by the agent if using service discovery. It can be accessed in the provided config template with `{{.Host}}`.  It will be set to the hostname or IP address of the discovered service. If you aren't using service discovery, you can just hardcode the host/port in the config template and ignore these fields. |
| `port` | no | `integer` | This should generally not be set manually, but will be filled in by the agent if using service discovery. It can be accessed in the provided config template with `{{.Port}}`.  It will be set to the port of the discovered service, if it is a TCP/UDP endpoint. (**default:** `0`) |
| `name` | no | `string` | This should generally not be set manually, but will be filled in by the agent if using service discovery. It can be accessed in the provided config template with `{{.Name}}`.  It will be set to the name that the observer creates for the endpoint upon discovery.  You can generally ignore this field. |
| `template` | no | `string` | A config template for collectd.  You can include as many plugin blocks as you want in this value.  It is rendered as a standard Go template, so be mindful of the delimiters `{{` and `}}`. |
| `templates` | no | `list of strings` | A list of templates, but otherwise equivalent to the above `template` option.  This enables you to have a single directory with collectd configuration files and load them all by using a globbed remote config value: |
| `collectdReadThreads` | no | `integer` | The number of read threads to use in collectd.  Will default to the number of templates provided, capped at 10, but if you manually specify it there is no limit. (**default:** `0`) |



The agent does not do any built-in filtering of metrics coming out of this
monitor.
