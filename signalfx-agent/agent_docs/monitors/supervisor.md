| Config option | Required | Type | Description |

| `host` | no | `string` | The host/ip address of the Supervisor XML-RPC API. This is used to construct the `url` option if not provided. |

generic monitor-level `extraMetrics` config option.  Metrics that are derived
from specific configuration options that do not appear in the above list of
metrics do not need to be added to `extraMetrics`.

To see a list of metrics that will be emitted you can run `agent-status
monitors` after configuring this monitor in a running agent instance.

dimensions may be specific to certain metrics.
