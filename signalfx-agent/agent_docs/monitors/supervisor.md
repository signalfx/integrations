| Config option | Required | Type | Description |

| `host` | no | `string` | The host/ip address of the Supervisor XML-RPC API. This is used to construct the `url` option if not provided. |
| `port` | no | `integer` | The port of the Supervisor XML-RPC API. This is used to construct the `url` option if not provided. (i.e. `localhost`) (**default:** `9001`) |

| `url` | no | `string` | URL on which to scrape Supervisor XML-RPC API. If this is not provided, it will be derive from the `host`, `port`, `useHTTPS`, and `path` options. (i.e. `http://localhost:9001/RPC2`) |

generic monitor-level `extraMetrics` config option.  Metrics that are derived
from specific configuration options that do not appear in the above list of
metrics do not need to be added to `extraMetrics`.

To see a list of metrics that will be emitted you can run `agent-status
monitors` after configuring this monitor in a running agent instance.

dimensions may be specific to certain metrics.
