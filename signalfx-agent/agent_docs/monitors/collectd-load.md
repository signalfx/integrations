# collectd/load

Monitor Type: `collectd/load` ([Source](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/main/pkg/monitors/collectd/load))

**Accepts Endpoints**: No

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: **No**

## Overview

Monitors process load on the host using the collectd
[Load plugin](https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:Load).

**This monitor has been deprecated in favor of the `load` monitor. That
monitor emits the same metrics and is fully compatible.  This
`collectd/load` monitor will be removed in a future release of the agent."


## Configuration

To activate this monitor in the Smart Agent, add the following to your
agent config:

```
monitors:  # All monitor config goes under this key
 - type: collectd/load
   ...  # Additional config
```

**For a list of monitor options that are common to all monitors, see [Common
Configuration](../monitor-config.html#common-configuration).**


This monitor has no configuration options.
## Metrics

These are the metrics available for this monitor.
Metrics that are categorized as
[container/host](https://docs.splunk.com/observability/admin/subscription-usage/monitor-imm-billing-usage.html#about-custom-bundled-and-high-resolution-metrics)
(*default*) are ***in bold and italics*** in the list below.


 - ***`load.longterm`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Average CPU load for the whole system over the last 15 minutes
 - ***`load.midterm`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Average CPU load for the whole system over the last five minutes
 - ***`load.shortterm`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Average CPU load for the whole system over the last one minute

### Non-default metrics (version 4.7.0+)

To emit metrics that are not _default_, you can add those metrics in the
generic monitor-level `extraMetrics` config option.  Metrics that are derived
from specific configuration options that do not appear in the above list of
metrics do not need to be added to `extraMetrics`.

To see a list of metrics that will be emitted you can run `agent-status
monitors` after configuring this monitor in a running agent instance.
