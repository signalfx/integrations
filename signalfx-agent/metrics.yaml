sfxagent.datapoint_channel_len:
  brief: The total number of datapoints that have been emitted by monitors but have
    yet to be accepted by the writer
  custom: false
  description: The total number of datapoints that have been emitted by monitors but
    have yet to be accepted by the writer. This number should be 0 most of the time.  This
    will max out at 3000, at which point no datapoints will be generated by monitors.  If
    it does max out, it indicates a bug or extreme CPU starvation of the agent.

  description: The total number of datapoints that have been accepted by the writer
    but have yet to be sent out to ingest over HTTP.  If this continues to grow it
    indicates that datapoints are not being sent out fast enough and the `writer.maxRequests`
    setting should be increased.
