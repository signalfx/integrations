### INSTALLATION

This integration is part of the [SignalFx Smart Agent](https://github.com/signalfx/integrations/tree/master/signalfx-agent)[](sfx_link:signalfx-agent)
as the `collectd/nginx` monitor. You should first deploy the Smart Agent to the
same host as the service you want to monitor, and then continue with the
configuration instructions below.

## Description

**This integration primarily consists of the Smart Agent monitor `collectd/nginx`.
Below is an overview of that monitor.**

### Smart Agent Monitor


Monitors an NGINX instance using our fork of the
collectd nginx plugin based on the [collectd nginx
plugin](https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:nginx).

Note that this montior requires special configuration enabled in NGINX (see Setup).

<!--- SETUP --->
### NGINX-specific configuration

You must configure NGINX to expose status information by editing the NGINX
configuration.  Please see
[ngx_http_stub_status_module](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_stub_status_module.html)
for a guide to configuring the NGINX stats module
`ngx_http_stub_status_module`.


## Configuration

To activate this monitor in the Smart Agent, add the following to your
agent config:

```
monitors:  # All monitor config goes under this key
 - type: collectd/nginx
   ...  # Additional config
```

**For a list of monitor options that are common to all monitors, see [Common
Configuration](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/docs/monitors/../monitor-config.md#common-configuration).**


| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `host` | **yes** | `string` |  |
| `port` | **yes** | `integer` |  |
| `name` | no | `string` |  |
| `url` | no | `string` | The full URL of the status endpoint; can be a template (**default:** `http://{{.Host}}:{{.Port}}/nginx_status`) |
| `username` | no | `string` |  |
| `password` | no | `string` |  |
| `timeout` | no | `integer` |  (**default:** `0`) |


## Metrics

Metrics that are categorized as
[container/host](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/admin-guide/usage.html#about-custom-bundled-and-high-resolution-metrics)
(*default*) are ***in bold and italics*** in the list below.

These are the metrics available for this integration.

 - ***`connections.accepted`*** (*cumulative*)<br>    Connections accepted by NGINX Web Server
 - `connections.failed` (*cumulative*)<br>    Connections failed by the NGINX Web Server
 - ***`connections.handled`*** (*cumulative*)<br>    Connections handled by NGINX Web Server
 - ***`nginx_connections.active`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Connections active in NGINX Web Server
 - ***`nginx_connections.reading`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Connections being read by NGINX Web Server
 - ***`nginx_connections.waiting`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Connections waited on by NGINX Web Server
 - ***`nginx_connections.writing`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Connections being written by NGINX Web Server
 - ***`nginx_requests`*** (*cumulative*)<br>    Requests handled by NGINX Web Server

### Non-default metrics (version 4.7.0+)

**The following information applies to the agent version 4.7.0+ that has
`enableBuiltInFiltering: true` set on the top level of the agent config.**

To emit metrics that are not _default_, you can add those metrics in the
generic monitor-level `extraMetrics` config option.  Metrics that are derived
from specific configuration options that do not appear in the above list of
metrics do not need to be added to `extraMetrics`.

To see a list of metrics that will be emitted you can run `agent-status
monitors` after configuring this monitor in a running agent instance.

### Legacy non-default metrics (version < 4.7.0)

**The following information only applies to agent version older than 4.7.0. If
you have a newer agent and have set `enableBuiltInFiltering: true` at the top
level of your agent config, see the section above. See upgrade instructions in
[Old-style whitelist filtering](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/docs/monitors/../legacy-filtering.md#old-style-whitelist-filtering).**

If you have a reference to the `whitelist.json` in your agent's top-level
`metricsToExclude` config option, and you want to emit metrics that are not in
that whitelist, then you need to add an item to the top-level
`metricsToInclude` config option to override that whitelist (see [Inclusion
filtering](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/docs/monitors/../legacy-filtering.md#inclusion-filtering).  Or you can just
copy the whitelist.json, modify it, and reference that in `metricsToExclude`.
