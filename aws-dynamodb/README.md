### INSTALLATION

To access this integration, [connect to CloudWatch](https://github.com/signalfx/integrations/tree/master/aws)[](sfx_link:aws).

By default, SignalFx will import all CloudWatch metrics that are available in your account. To retrieve metrics for a subset of available services or regions, modify the connection on the Integrations page.

### USAGE

SignalFx provides built-in dashboards for this service. Examples are shown below.

- Average Latency (latest)
    - Successful requests to DynamoDB or Amazon DynamoDB Streams during the specified time period.

- Average Latency (by request type)
    - Successful requests to DynamoDB or Amazon DynamoDB Streams during the specified time period.
    - [<img src='./img/avg_latency_by_type.png' width=350px>](./img/avg_latency_by_type.png)
- Throttled Requests (latest)
    - Requests to DynamoDB that exceed the provisioned throughput limits on a resource (such as a table or an index).

    - Requests to DynamoDB or Amazon DynamoDB Streams that generate an HTTP 500 status code during the specified time period.
- Consumed Read Capacity Units
    - The number of read capacity units consumed over the specified time period, so you can track how much of your provisioned throughput is used.

- Consumed Read Capacity Units
    - The number of write capacity units consumed over the specified time period, so you can track how much of your provisioned throughput is used.
    - [<img src='./img/consumed_write_capacity.png' width=350px>](./img/consumed_write_capacity.png)
- Average Provisioned Read Capacity Units
    - The average number of provisioned read capacity units for a table or a global secondary index.
