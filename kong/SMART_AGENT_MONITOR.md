### INSTALLATION

This integration is part of the [SignalFx Smart Agent](https://github.com/signalfx/integrations/tree/master/signalfx-agent)[](sfx_link:signalfx-agent)
as the `collectd/kong` monitor. You should first deploy the Smart Agent to the
same host as the service you want to monitor, and then continue with the
configuration instructions below.

## Description

**This integration primarily consists of the Smart Agent monitor `collectd/kong`.
Below is an overview of that monitor.**

### Smart Agent Monitor


Monitors a Kong instance using
[collectd-kong](https://github.com/signalfx/collectd-kong).  The Smart
Agent includes collectd and this plugin as part of the standard
installation, so no additional installation is required once you have the
Smart Agent.

The SignalFx Kong collectd plugin provides users with the ability to gather
and report their service traffic metrics with collectd, in tandem with
[kong-plugin-signalfx](https://github.com/signalfx/kong-plugin-signalfx).

This plugin emits metrics for configurable request/response lifecycle groups including:

* Counters for response counts
* Counters for cumulative response and request sizes
* Counters for cumulative request, upstream, and Kong latencies

These request/response lifecycle groups can be optionally partitioned by tunable levels of granularity by:

* API or Service Name/ID
* Route ID
* Request HTTP Method
* Response HTTP Status Code

In addition to these groups, system-wide connection stats can be provided, including:

* A counter for total fielded requests
* Gauges for active connections and their various states
* A gauge for database connectivity

The `metrics` field below is populated with a set of metrics that are
described at https://github.com/signalfx/collectd-kong/blob/master/README.md.

## Metrics

Metrics that are categorized as
[container/host](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/admin-guide/usage.html#about-custom-bundled-and-high-resolution-metrics)
(*default*) are ***in bold and italics*** in the list below.

These are the metrics available for this integration.

 - ***`counter.kong.requests.count`*** (*cumulative*)<br>    Total number of all requests made to Kong API and proxy server.
 - ***`counter.kong.requests.latency`*** (*cumulative*)<br>    Time elapsed between the first bytes being read from each client request and the log writes after the last bytes were sent to the clients (ms).
 - ***`counter.kong.requests.size`*** (*cumulative*)<br>    Total bytes received/proxied from client requests.
 - ***`counter.kong.responses.count`*** (*cumulative*)<br>    Total number of responses provided to clients.
 - ***`counter.kong.responses.size`*** (*cumulative*)<br>    Total bytes sent/proxied to clients.

### Non-default metrics (version 4.7.0+)

**The following information applies to the agent version 4.7.0+ that has
`enableBuiltInFiltering: true` set on the top level of the agent config.**

To emit metrics that are not _default_, you can add those metrics in the
generic monitor-level `extraMetrics` config option.  Metrics that are derived
from specific configuration options that do not appear in the above list of
metrics do not need to be added to `extraMetrics`.

To see a list of metrics that will be emitted you can run `agent-status
monitors` after configuring this monitor in a running agent instance.

### Legacy non-default metrics (version < 4.7.0)

**The following information only applies to agent version older than 4.7.0. If
you have a newer agent and have set `enableBuiltInFiltering: true` at the top
level of your agent config, see the section above. See upgrade instructions in
[Old-style whitelist filtering](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/docs/monitors/../legacy-filtering.md#old-style-whitelist-filtering).**

If you have a reference to the `whitelist.json` in your agent's top-level
`metricsToExclude` config option, and you want to emit metrics that are not in
that whitelist, then you need to add an item to the top-level
`metricsToInclude` config option to override that whitelist (see [Inclusion
filtering](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/docs/monitors/../legacy-filtering.md#inclusion-filtering).  Or you can just
copy the whitelist.json, modify it, and reference that in `metricsToExclude`.
