    on how your [kubelet is configured to prune dead containers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/kubelet-garbage-collection/).
    It is best to not depend too much on the exact value but rather look at it as
    either `== 0`, in which case you can conclude there were no restarts in the recent
    past, or `> 0`, in which case you can conclude there were restarts in the recent
    past, and not try and analyze the value beyond that.
