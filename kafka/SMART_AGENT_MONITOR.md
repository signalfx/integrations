### INSTALLATION

This integration is part of the [SignalFx Smart Agent](https://github.com/signalfx/integrations/tree/master/signalfx-agent)[](sfx_link:signalfx-agent)
as the `collectd/kafka` monitor. You should first deploy the Smart Agent to the
same host as the service you want to monitor, and then continue with the
configuration instructions below.

## Description

This integration primarily consists of the Smart Agent monitor `collectd/kafka`.
Below is an overview of that monitor.

### Smart Agent Monitor


Monitors a Kafka instance using collectd's
GenericJMX plugin. See the [collectd/genericjmx
monitor](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/main/docs/monitors/./collectd-genericjmx.md)[](sfx_link:java) for more information on
how to configure custom MBeans, as well as information on troubleshooting
JMX setup.

This monitor has a set of [built in MBeans
configured](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/main/pkg/monitors/collectd/kafka/mbeans.go)
for which it pulls metrics from Kafka's JMX endpoint.

Note that this monitor supports Kafka v0.8.2.x and above. For Kafka v1.x.x and above,
apart from the list of default metrics, kafka.server:type=ZooKeeperClientMetrics,name=ZooKeeperRequestLatencyMs
is a good metric to monitor since it gives an understanding of how long brokers wait for
requests to Zookeeper to be completed. Since Zookeeper is an integral part of a Kafka cluster,
monitoring it using the [Zookeeper
monitor](https://docs.splunk.com/observability/gdi/zookeeper/zookeeper.html)[](sfx_link:zookeeper)
is recommended. It is also a good idea to monitor disk utilization and network metrics of
the underlying host.


## Configuration

To activate this monitor in the Smart Agent, add the following to your
agent config:

```
monitors:  # All monitor config goes under this key
 - type: collectd/kafka
   ...  # Additional config
```

**For a list of monitor options that are common to all monitors, see [Common
Configuration](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/main/docs/monitors/../monitor-config.md#common-configuration).**


| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `host` | **yes** | `string` | Host to connect to -- JMX must be configured for remote access and accessible from the agent |
| `port` | **yes** | `integer` | JMX connection port (NOT the RMI port) on the application.  This correponds to the `com.sun.management.jmxremote.port` Java property that should be set on the JVM when running the application. |
| `name` | no | `string` |  |
| `serviceName` | no | `string` | This is how the service type is identified in the SignalFx UI so that you can get built-in content for it.  For custom JMX integrations, it can be set to whatever you like and metrics will get the special property `sf_hostHasService` set to this value. |
| `serviceURL` | no | `string` | The JMX connection string.  This is rendered as a Go template and has access to the other values in this config. NOTE: under normal circumstances it is not advised to set this string directly - setting the host and port as specified above is preferred. (**default:** `service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://{{.Host}}:{{.Port}}/jmxrmi`) |
| `instancePrefix` | no | `string` | Prefixes the generated plugin instance with prefix. If a second `instancePrefix` is specified in a referenced MBean block, the prefix specified in the Connection block will appear at the beginning of the plugin instance, and the prefix specified in the MBean block will be appended to it |
| `username` | no | `string` | Username to authenticate to the server |
| `password` | no | `string` | User password to authenticate to the server |
| `customDimensions` | no | `map of strings` | Takes in key-values pairs of custom dimensions at the connection level. |
| `mBeansToCollect` | no | `list of strings` | A list of the MBeans defined in `mBeanDefinitions` to actually collect. If not provided, then all defined MBeans will be collected. |
| `mBeansToOmit` | no | `list of strings` | A list of the MBeans to omit. This will come handy in cases where only a few MBeans need to omitted from the default list |
| `mBeanDefinitions` | no | `map of objects (see below)` | Specifies how to map JMX MBean values to metrics.  If using a specific service monitor such as cassandra, kafka, or activemq, they come pre-loaded with a set of mappings, and any that you add in this option will be merged with those.  See [collectd GenericJMX](https://collectd.org/documentation/manpages/collectd-java.5.shtml#genericjmx_plugin) for more details. |
| `clusterName` | **yes** | `string` | Cluster name to which the broker belongs |


The **nested** `mBeanDefinitions` config object has the following fields:

| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `objectName` | no | `string` | Sets the pattern which is used to retrieve MBeans from the MBeanServer. If more than one MBean is returned you should use the `instanceFrom` option to make the identifiers unique |
| `instancePrefix` | no | `string` | Prefixes the generated plugin instance with prefix |
| `instanceFrom` | no | `list of strings` | The object names used by JMX to identify MBeans include so called "properties" which are basically key-value-pairs. If the given object name is not unique and multiple MBeans are returned, the values of those properties usually differ. You can use this option to build the plugin instance from the appropriate property values. This option is optional and may be repeated to generate the plugin instance from multiple property values |
| `values` | no | `list of objects (see below)` | The `value` blocks map one or more attributes of an MBean to a value list in collectd. There must be at least one `value` block within each MBean block |
| `dimensions` | no | `list of strings` |  |


The **nested** `values` config object has the following fields:

| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | no | `string` | Sets the data set used within collectd to handle the values of the MBean attribute |
| `table` | no | `bool` | Set this to true if the returned attribute is a composite type. If set to true, the keys within the composite type is appended to the type instance. (**default:** `false`) |
| `instancePrefix` | no | `string` | Works like the option of the same name directly beneath the MBean block, but sets the type instance instead |
| `instanceFrom` | no | `list of strings` | Works like the option of the same name directly beneath the MBean block, but sets the type instance instead |
| `attribute` | no | `string` | Sets the name of the attribute from which to read the value. You can access the keys of composite types by using a dot to concatenate the key name to the attribute name. For example: “attrib0.key42”. If `table` is set to true, path must point to a composite type, otherwise it must point to a numeric type. |
| `attributes` | no | `list of strings` | The plural form of the `attribute` config above.  Used to derive multiple metrics from a single MBean. |


## Metrics

Metrics that are categorized as
[container/host](https://docs.splunk.com/observability/admin/subscription-usage/monitor-imm-billing-usage.html#about-custom-bundled-and-high-resolution-metrics)
(*default*) are ***in bold and italics*** in the list below.

These are the metrics available for this integration.

 - ***`counter.kafka-bytes-in`*** (*cumulative*)<br>    Number of bytes received per second across all topics
 - ***`counter.kafka-bytes-out`*** (*cumulative*)<br>    Number of bytes transmitted per second across all topics
 - ***`counter.kafka-isr-expands`*** (*cumulative*)<br>    When a broker is brought up after a failure, it starts catching up by reading from the leader. Once it is caught up, it gets added back to the ISR.
 - ***`counter.kafka-isr-shrinks`*** (*cumulative*)<br>    When a broker goes down, ISR for some of partitions will shrink. When that broker is up again, ISR will be expanded once the replicas are fully caught up. Other than that, the expected value for both ISR shrink rate and expansion rate is 0.
 - `counter.kafka-leader-election-rate` (*cumulative*)<br>    Number of leader elections
 - ***`counter.kafka-messages-in`*** (*cumulative*)<br>    Number of messages received per second across all topics
 - ***`counter.kafka-unclean-elections-rate`*** (*cumulative*)<br>    Number of unclean leader elections. This happens when a leader goes down and an out-of-sync replica is chosen to be the leader
 - ***`counter.kafka.fetch-consumer.total-time.count`*** (*cumulative*)<br>    Number of fetch requests from consumers per second across all partitions
 - `counter.kafka.fetch-follower.total-time.count` (*cumulative*)<br>    Number of fetch requests from followers per second across all partitions
 - `counter.kafka.logs.flush-time.count` (*cumulative*)<br>    Number of log flushes
 - ***`counter.kafka.produce.total-time.count`*** (*cumulative*)<br>    Number of producer requests
 - ***`gauge.kafka-active-controllers`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Specifies if the broker an active controller
 - ***`gauge.kafka-max-lag`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Maximum lag in messages between the follower and leader replicas
 - ***`gauge.kafka-offline-partitions-count`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Number of partitions that don’t have an active leader and are hence not writable or readable
 - ***`gauge.kafka-request-queue`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Number of requests in the request queue across all partitions on the broker
 - ***`gauge.kafka-underreplicated-partitions`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Number of underreplicated partitions across all topics on the broker
 - ***`gauge.kafka.fetch-consumer.total-time.99th`*** (*gauge*)<br>    99th percentile of time in milliseconds to process fetch requests from consumers
 - ***`gauge.kafka.fetch-consumer.total-time.median`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Median time it takes to process a fetch request from consumers
 - ***`gauge.kafka.fetch-follower.total-time.99th`*** (*gauge*)<br>    99th percentile of time in milliseconds to process fetch requests from followers
 - ***`gauge.kafka.fetch-follower.total-time.median`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Median time it takes to process a fetch request from follower
 - `gauge.kafka.logs.flush-time.99th` (*gauge*)<br>    99th percentile of time in milliseconds to flush logs
 - `gauge.kafka.logs.flush-time.median` (*gauge*)<br>    Median time it takes to flush logs
 - ***`gauge.kafka.produce.total-time.99th`*** (*gauge*)<br>    99th percentile of time in milliseconds to process produce requests
 - ***`gauge.kafka.produce.total-time.median`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Median time it takes to process a produce request

#### Group jvm
All of the following metrics are part of the `jvm` metric group. All of
the non-default metrics below can be turned on by adding `jvm` to the
monitor config option `extraGroups`:
 - ***`gauge.jvm.threads.count`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Number of JVM threads
 - ***`gauge.loaded_classes`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Number of classes loaded in the JVM
 - ***`invocations`*** (*cumulative*)<br>    Total number of garbage collection events
 - ***`jmx_memory.committed`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Amount of memory guaranteed to be available in bytes
 - ***`jmx_memory.init`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Amount of initial memory at startup in bytes
 - ***`jmx_memory.max`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Maximum amount of memory that can be used in bytes
 - ***`jmx_memory.used`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Current memory usage in bytes
 - ***`total_time_in_ms.collection_time`*** (*cumulative*)<br>    Amount of time spent garbage collecting in milliseconds

### Non-default metrics (version 4.7.0+)

**The following information applies to the agent version 4.7.0+ that has
`enableBuiltInFiltering: true` set on the top level of the agent config.**

To emit metrics that are not _default_, you can add those metrics in the
generic monitor-level `extraMetrics` config option.  Metrics that are derived
from specific configuration options that do not appear in the above list of
metrics do not need to be added to `extraMetrics`.

To see a list of metrics that will be emitted you can run `agent-status
monitors` after configuring this monitor in a running agent instance.

### Legacy non-default metrics (version < 4.7.0)

**The following information only applies to agent versions prior to 4.7.0. If
you have a newer agent and have set `enableBuiltInFiltering: true` at the top
level of your agent config, see the section above. See upgrade instructions in
[Old-style inclusion list filtering](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/main/docs/monitors/../legacy-filtering.md#old-style-inclusion-list-filtering).**

If you have a reference to the `whitelist.json` in your agent's top-level
`metricsToExclude` config option, and you want to emit metrics that are not in
that allow list, then you need to add an item to the top-level
`metricsToInclude` config option to override that allow list (see [Inclusion
filtering](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/main/docs/monitors/../legacy-filtering.md#inclusion-filtering).  Or you can just
copy the whitelist.json, modify it, and reference that in `metricsToExclude`.
