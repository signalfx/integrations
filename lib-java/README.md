### DESCRIPTION

Java instrumentation is available from the
[Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Java](https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-java). This instrumentation agent provides
feature-rich auto-instrumentation with very little manual configuration.
It is built on top of the industry standard [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/).

Users building manual instrumentation can also leverage the 
[OpenTelemetry Java SDK](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java)
to send telemetry to Splunk.
