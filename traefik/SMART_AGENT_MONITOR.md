### INSTALLATION

This integration is part of the [SignalFx Smart Agent](https://github.com/signalfx/integrations/tree/master/signalfx-agent)[](sfx_link:signalfx-agent)
as the `traefik` monitor. You should first deploy the Smart Agent to the
same host as the service you want to monitor, and then continue with the
configuration instructions below.

## Description

This integration primarily consists of the Smart Agent monitor `traefik`.
Below is an overview of that monitor.

### Smart Agent Monitor


Traefik is an open-source HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer. Traefik exports Prometheus metrics that can be
scraped by the SignalFx Smart Agent. These metrics can be categorized into Traefik-related, entrypoint-related and
backend-related metrics. The Traefik-related metrics are prefixed by `go_` and `process_`. The entrypoint-related
metrics are prefixed by `traefik_entrypoint_` and the backend-related metrics prefixed by `traefik_backend_`.

The Traefik-related metrics are for monitoring Traefik itself. For instance, the `go_memstats_sys_bytes` metric can
be used to plot Traefik memory usage. The entrypoint-related and backend-related metrics are the number and duration
of requests measured at entrypoints and backends. These metrics are used to compute measurements such as the average
request duration.

## Requirements and Dependencies

| Software          | Version        |
|-------------------|----------------|
| signalfx-agent    |     4.7.0+     |

## Traefik Configuration

Edit the Traefik configuration file, typically `traefik.toml`, to enable Traefik to expose prometheus metrics at an
endpoint. The endpoint is on path `/metrics` by default. When running the Traefik binary, the configuration file is
typically passed in as a command line argument. For example,

`./traefik -c traefik.toml`

However, when running the Traefik Docker image, the configuration file is mounted to volume
`/etc/traefik/traefik.toml`. For example,

`docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -p 80:80 -v $PWD/traefik.toml:/etc/traefik/traefik.toml`

If the Traefik configuration file is not available use the sample configuration file
<a target="_blank" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/containous/traefik/master/traefik.sample.toml">here</a>
to get started.

See <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.traefik.io/">here</a> for complete Traefik docs.

## Smart Agent Configuration

SignalFx Smart Agent docs can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent">here</a>.
Choose deployment specific configuration instruction
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/main/deployments">here</a>. The
SignalFx Smart Agent must have network access to Traefik.

Below is an example configuration that enables the traefik monitor. For the given configuration below, the monitor
will scrape Prometheus metrics in the default path `/metrics` on port 8080, add dimension
`metric_source=traefik` to the metrics and export them to SignalFx.

```
monitors:
- type: traefik
  discoveryRule: port == 8080
  extraDimensions:
    metric_source: traefik
```


## Configuration

To activate this monitor in the Smart Agent, add the following to your
agent config:

```
monitors:  # All monitor config goes under this key
 - type: traefik
   ...  # Additional config
```

**For a list of monitor options that are common to all monitors, see [Common
Configuration](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/main/docs/monitors/../monitor-config.md#common-configuration).**


| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `httpTimeout` | no | `integer` | HTTP timeout duration for both read and writes. This should be a duration string that is accepted by https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration (**default:** `10s`) |
| `username` | no | `string` | Basic Auth username to use on each request, if any. |
| `password` | no | `string` | Basic Auth password to use on each request, if any. |
| `useHTTPS` | no | `bool` | If true, the agent will connect to the server using HTTPS instead of plain HTTP. (**default:** `false`) |
| `httpHeaders` | no | `map of strings` | A map of HTTP header names to values. Comma separated multiple values for the same message-header is supported. |
| `skipVerify` | no | `bool` | If useHTTPS is true and this option is also true, the exporter's TLS cert will not be verified. (**default:** `false`) |
| `sniServerName` | no | `string` | If useHTTPS is true and skipVerify is true, the sniServerName is used to verify the hostname on the returned certificates. It is also included in the client's handshake to support virtual hosting unless it is an IP address. |
| `caCertPath` | no | `string` | Path to the CA cert that has signed the TLS cert, unnecessary if `skipVerify` is set to false. |
| `clientCertPath` | no | `string` | Path to the client TLS cert to use for TLS required connections |
| `clientKeyPath` | no | `string` | Path to the client TLS key to use for TLS required connections |
| `host` | **yes** | `string` | Host of the exporter |
| `port` | **yes** | `integer` | Port of the exporter |
| `useServiceAccount` | no | `bool` | Use pod service account to authenticate. (**default:** `false`) |
| `metricPath` | no | `string` | Path to the metrics endpoint on the exporter server, usually `/metrics` (the default). (**default:** `/metrics`) |
| `sendAllMetrics` | no | `bool` | Send all the metrics that come out of the Prometheus exporter without any filtering.  This option has no effect when using the prometheus exporter monitor directly since there is no built-in filtering, only when embedding it in other monitors. (**default:** `false`) |

### Non-default metrics (version 4.7.0+)

**The following information applies to the agent version 4.7.0+ that has
`enableBuiltInFiltering: true` set on the top level of the agent config.**

To emit metrics that are not _default_, you can add those metrics in the
generic monitor-level `extraMetrics` config option.  Metrics that are derived
from specific configuration options that do not appear in the above list of
metrics do not need to be added to `extraMetrics`.

To see a list of metrics that will be emitted you can run `agent-status
monitors` after configuring this monitor in a running agent instance.

### Legacy non-default metrics (version < 4.7.0)

**The following information only applies to agent versions prior to 4.7.0. If
you have a newer agent and have set `enableBuiltInFiltering: true` at the top
level of your agent config, see the section above. See upgrade instructions in
[Old-style inclusion list filtering](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/main/docs/monitors/../legacy-filtering.md#old-style-inclusion-list-filtering).**

If you have a reference to the `whitelist.json` in your agent's top-level
`metricsToExclude` config option, and you want to emit metrics that are not in
that allow list, then you need to add an item to the top-level
`metricsToInclude` config option to override that allow list (see [Inclusion
filtering](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/main/docs/monitors/../legacy-filtering.md#inclusion-filtering).  Or you can just
copy the whitelist.json, modify it, and reference that in `metricsToExclude`.
