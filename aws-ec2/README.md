### DESCRIPTION

Use SignalFx to monitor Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) via [Amazon Web Services](https://github.com/signalfx/integrations/tree/master/aws)[](sfx_link:aws).

#### FEATURES

##### Infrastructure Page

- **Infrastructure Navigator**: On the Infrastructure page in SignalFx, the Infrastructure Navigator visualizes EC2 instances as squares, colored by CloudWatch metrics including CPU, disk, and network. Group and filter instances by AWS metadata like availability zone or service tag in order to discover trends and correlations. <a target="_blank" href="http://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/built-in-content/infra-nav.html">Click here to read more about the Infrastructure Page</a>.

##### Built-in dashboards

- **EC2 Instances**: Overview of all data from EC2.

- **EC2 Instance**: Focus on a single EC2 instance.

### INSTALLATION

To access this integration, [connect to CloudWatch](https://github.com/signalfx/integrations/tree/master/aws)[](sfx_link:aws).

By default, SignalFx will import all CloudWatch metrics that are available in your account. To retrieve metrics for a subset of available services or regions, modify the connection on the Integrations page.

### USAGE

#### Uniquely identifying EC2 instances

EC2 instance IDs are not guaranteed to be unique. To uniquely identify an EC2 instance, SignalFx concatenates instanceId, AWS region, and AWS account ID separated by underscore in the dimension `AWSUniqueId`, as follows:
```
    instanceId_region_accountID
```

#### EC2 metadata

For EC2, SignalFx will scan every instance ID from your AWS account and pull out properties of the instance and any tags set on the instance.  Any dimension called “Host” or “InstanceId” in SignalFx that matches the instance ID’s value, private DNS name, or private IP address will now have the same tags and properties of the instance ID.  Each instance property is prefixed with “aws_”.
