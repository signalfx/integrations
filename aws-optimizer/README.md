### DESCRIPTION

Use SignalFx to optimize EC2 Usage & Cost via [Amazon Web Services](https://github.com/signalfx/integrations/tree/master/aws)[](sfx_link:aws).

SignalFx AWS Optimizer gives you actionable insight into cost-saving opportunities, underutilized investments, usage patterns, and cost attribution. You can view data by InstanceType, AWS Region, AWS availability Zone and categories specific to your setup, such as Service, Team, or any other dimensions that are sourced from EC2 instance tags. SignalFx makes calls to the AWS API to retrieve cost and usage data and derives metrics with which you can visualize EC2 usage and approximated costs. You can also create detectors based on this data, so you can get alerted in real-time on unexpected changes in cost or usage patterns.

Notes on using AWS Optimizer:
- The imported data does not include AWS Billing data.
- Data is not imported for EC2 Spot Instances.
- If you have multiple AWS Accounts, they must all be included in the SignalFx AWS integration and have “Import data for SignalFx AWS Optimizer” selected. If this is not the case, the generated metrics will not reflect accurate values.

#### FEATURES
