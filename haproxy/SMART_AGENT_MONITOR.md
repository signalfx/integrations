### INSTALLATION

This integration is part of the [SignalFx Smart Agent](https://github.com/signalfx/integrations/tree/master/signalfx-agent)[](sfx_link:signalfx-agent)
as the `collectd/haproxy` monitor. You should first deploy the Smart Agent to the
same host as the service you want to monitor, and then continue with the
configuration instructions below.

## Description

**This integration primarily consists of the Smart Agent monitor `collectd/haproxy`.
Below is an overview of that monitor.**

### Smart Agent Monitor


This monitors an [HAProxy](http://www.haproxy.org/) instance.  Requires HAProxy 1.5+.

<!--- SETUP --->
### Socket Config
The location of the HAProxy socket file is defined in the HAProxy config file, as in the following example:

```
global
    daemon
    stats socket /var/run/haproxy.sock
    stats timeout 2m
```

Note: it is possible to use a tcp socket for stats in HAProxy. Users will
first need to define in their collectd-haproxy plugin config file the tcp
address for the socket, for example `localhost:9000`, and then in the
haproxy.cfg file change the stats socket to listen on the same address
```
global
    daemon
    stats socket localhost:9000
    stats timeout 2m
```

For a more restricted tcp socket, a backend server can be defined to listen
to stats on localhost. A frontend proxy can use the backend server on a
different port, with ACLs to restrict access. See below for example.
Depending on how restrictive your socket is, you may need to add the
signalfx-agent user to the haproxy group:
`sudo usermod -a -G haproxy signalfx-agent`

```
global
    daemon
    stats socket localhost:9000
    stats timeout 2m

backend stats-backend
    mode tcp
    server stats-localhost localhost:9000

frontend stats-frontend
    bind *:9001
    default_backend stats-backend
    acl ...
    acl ...
```

<!--- SETUP --->
### SELinux Setup

If you have SELinux enabled, create a SELinux policy package downloading
the [type enforcement
file](https://github.com/signalfx/collectd-haproxy/blob/master/selinux/collectd-haproxy.te)
to some place on your server.  Run the commands below to create and install
the policy package.

    $ checkmodule -M -m -o collectd-haproxy.mod collectd-haproxy.te
    checkmodule:  loading policy configuration from collectd-haproxy.te
    checkmodule:  policy configuration loaded
    checkmodule:  writing binary representation (version 17) to collectd-haproxy.mod
    $ semodule_package -o collectd-haproxy.pp -m collectd-haproxy.mod
    $ sudo semodule -i collectd-haproxy.pp
    $ sudo reboot


## Configuration

To activate this monitor in the Smart Agent, add the following to your
agent config:

```
monitors:  # All monitor config goes under this key
 - type: collectd/haproxy
   ...  # Additional config
```

### Non-default metrics (version 4.7.0+)

**The following information applies to the agent version 4.7.0+ that has
`enableBuiltInFiltering: true` set on the top level of the agent config.**

To emit metrics that are not _default_, you can add those metrics in the
generic monitor-level `extraMetrics` config option.  Metrics that are derived
from specific configuration options that do not appear in the above list of
metrics do not need to be added to `extraMetrics`.

To see a list of metrics that will be emitted you can run `agent-status
monitors` after configuring this monitor in a running agent instance.

### Legacy non-default metrics (version < 4.7.0)

**The following information only applies to agent version older than 4.7.0. If
you have a newer agent and have set `enableBuiltInFiltering: true` at the top
level of your agent config, see the section above. See upgrade instructions in
[Old-style allow list filtering](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/docs/monitors/../legacy-filtering.md#old-style-allow-list-filtering).**

If you have a reference to the `whitelist.json` in your agent's top-level
`metricsToExclude` config option, and you want to emit metrics that are not in
that allow list, then you need to add an item to the top-level
`metricsToInclude` config option to override that allow list (see [Inclusion
filtering](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/docs/monitors/../legacy-filtering.md#inclusion-filtering).  Or you can just
copy the whitelist.json, modify it, and reference that in `metricsToExclude`.
