# Install:
#   This is a Python-based plugin using third-party code by SignalFx. Clone the
#   plugin's repository and install its Python dependencies:
#     git clone \
#         https://github.com/signalfx/collectd-elasticsearch.git \
#         /usr/share/collectd/collectd-elasticsearch
#     service collectd restart

# Documentation:
#   https://github.com/signalfx/collectd-elasticsearch.git

# System modifications:
#   None

# Config file modifications:
#   - The defaults should work for a recent, standard Elasticsearch installation.
#   - Change Cluster to match the cluster name that is configured by Elasticsearch.
#   - Enable/disable cluster health stats. These are enabled by default.
#   - Enable/disable index stats. These are disabled by default. SignalFx recommends 
#      enabling index stats collection only on master-eligible Elasticsearch nodes. 
#   - Configuring per-index statistics:
#      To retrieve statistics for a specific index, you can set the Index configuration
#      option with the name of the index. For example Indexes ["index1"]. You can also
#      set it to multiple indexes in a comma separated format : Indexes ["index1", "index2"].
#      To retrieve statistics for all indexes, use the special "_all" index : Indexes ["_all"]
#      To disable index statistic collection set EnableIndexStats to false.
#
#     You may specify which thread pools you would like to collect metrics for
#     with a comma separated list of threadpool names. "search" and "index" are required to
#     properly populate the default dashboards.
#     The following threadpool names are acceptable:
#       - Common to all supported versions: generic, get, snapshot, bulk, warmer, flush, refresh
#       - 1.x only: merge, optimize
#       - ES 2.0 +: suggest, percolate, management, listener, fetch_shard_store, fetch_shard_started
#       - ES 2.1 +: force_merge
#
#     Ex.
#        ThreadPools ["generic","index","get","snapshot","bulk","warmer","flush","search","refresh"]
#
#   - The plugin assumes Elasticsearch is accessible on localhost:9200.  If you need to specify
#     a different host and port.  Use assign the appropriate host and port to "Host" and "Port"
#     Ex.
#         Host alternate_hostname
#         Port 9320
#
#   - The DetailedMetrics setting enables the emission of all metrics collected by the plugin.
#     Detailed metrics may be turned on by setting DetailedMetrics to the 
#     appropriate boolean value 'true' or 'false'.  If the value is false a minimal set of default values
#     will be collected.
#     Ex.
#         DetailedMetrics true
#     If you wish to specify individual additional metrics please use the AdditionalDefaultMetrics (below)
#
#   - By default the Index stats are emitted every 300 seconds.  The 'IndexInterval'
#     is configurable with an integer number of seconds.  It must be greater than or equal to
#     and divisible by the configured 'Interval'.  If an incompatible 'IndexInterval' is configured,
#     it will be rounded up to the configured 'Interval' or to the next highest compatible interval time
#
#   - Additional Default Metric values can be specified in a python list.  Note that the metric
#     That are specified must match the metric names as defined in the elasticsearch_collectd.py file.
#     Ex.
#        AdditionalDefaultMetrics ["jvm.mem.non-heap-used", "jvm.mem.pools.young.max_in_bytes"]
#     If no additional metrics are desired, assign a list with a blank string entry to AdditionalDefaultMetrics
#     Ex.
#        AdditionalDefaultMetrics [""]
#
#   - Basic Authentication support:
#      If your Elasticsearch installation has basic authentication set up, then you may specify
#      a username and password in this file by setting the properties "Username" and "Password"
#      with the corresponding values.
