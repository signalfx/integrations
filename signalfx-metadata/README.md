### DESCRIPTION

This SignalFx plugin for collectd configures collectd to aggregate metrics and send them to SignalFx. This plugin also handles the association to a specific SignalFx org to the data that is being sent through the org's API token.

### REQUIREMENTS AND DEPENDENCIES

This plugin requires:

| Software          | Version        |
|-------------------|----------------|
| collectd  |  4.9+  |
| Python plugin for collectd | (included with [SignalFx collectd agent](https://github.com/signalfx/integrations/tree/master/collectd)[](sfx_link:collectd)) |
| Python    |  2.6+ |

### INSTALLATION

1. Download the Python module from the following URL:

        https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-collectd-plugin

2. Download SignalFx’s <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/signalfx/integrations/blob/master/signalfx-metadata/10-signalfx.conf">sample configuration file</a>.

3. Modify the configuration file as follows:

    1. Modify the fields “TypesDB and “ModulePath” to point to the location on disk where you downloaded the Python module in step 2.

    2. Provide values that make sense for your environment, as described [below](#configuration).

4. Add the following line to /etc/collectd.conf, replacing the example path with the location of the configuration file you downloaded in step 4:

        include '/path/to/10-signalfx.conf'

5. Restart collectd.

collectd will begin emitting metrics to SignalFx.

### CONFIGURATION

#### Configuring the plugin

Before we can send metrics to SignalFx, we need to make sure you are sending them to
the correct SignalFx realm. To determine what realm you are in (YOUR_SIGNALFX_REALM), check your
profile page in the SignalFx web application (click the avatar in the upper right and click My Profile).
If you are not in the `us0` realm, you will need to set the `URL` configuration option below
to use the correct realm, as shown below.

You will also need to set the `Token` configuration option to your SignalFx organization access token (YOUR_SIGNALFX_API_TOKEN).
For more information on authentication, see the API's [Authentication documentation](https://developers.signalfx.com/basics/authentication.html).


#### Configuration options


| configuration option | definition | default value |
| ---------------------|------------|---------------|
| ModulePath | Path on disk where collectd can find this module. | "/opt/signalfx-collectd-plugin" |
| URL | URL for where metrics are sent from collectd. If you are looking to limit the number of connections from your infrastructure to the SignalFx service you can optionally configure the use of the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/signalfx/integrations/tree/master/metricproxy">SignalFx metricproxy</a> | "https://ingest.us0.signalfx.com/v1/collectd" |
| Token | Your SignalFx Organization Access Token | none |
| LogTraces | Enable log traces | true |
| Notifications | Enable notification on this plugin | true |
| NotifyLevel | Set the notification level | "OKAY" |
| PerCoreCPUUtil | Enable cpu utilization per core metrics.  This requires the [filtering.conf](../collectd-match\_regex/filtering.conf) file| false |
