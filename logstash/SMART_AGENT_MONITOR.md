### INSTALLATION

This integration is part of the [SignalFx Smart Agent](https://github.com/signalfx/integrations/tree/master/signalfx-agent)[](sfx_link:signalfx-agent)
as the `logstash`, `logstash-tcp` monitors. You should first deploy the Smart Agent to the
same host as the service you want to monitor, and then continue with the
configuration instructions below.

## Description

**This integration primarily consists of the Smart Agent monitors `logstash`, `logstash-tcp`.
Below is an overview of the monitors.**

### Smart Agent Monitors

#### logstash monitor
Monitors the health and performance of Logstash deployments through 
Logstash's [Monitoring APIs](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/monitoring-logstash.html).

#### logstash-tcp monitor
Fetches events from the [logstash tcp output
plugin](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/plugins-outputs-tcp.html)
operating in either `server` or `client` mode and converts them to SignalFx
datapoints.  It is meant to be used in conjunction with the Logstash
[Metrics filter
plugin](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/plugins-filters-metrics.html)
that turns events into metrics.

You can only use auto-discovery when this monitor is in `client` mode.

### Example Logstash Config

This is a somewhat contrived example that shows the use of both `timer` and
`meter` metrics from the Logstash Metrics filter plugin:

```
input {
  file {
    path => "/var/log/auth.log"
    start_position => "beginning"
    tags => ["auth_log"]
  }

  # A contrived file that contains timing messages
  file {
    path => "/var/log/durations.log"
    tags => ["duration_log"]
    start_position => "beginning"
  }
}

filter {
  if "duration_log" in [tags] {
    dissect {
      mapping => {
        "message" => "Processing took %{duration} seconds"
      }
      convert_datatype => {
        "duration" => "float"
      }
    }
    if "_dissectfailure" not in [tags] { # Filter out bad events
      metrics {
        timer => { "process_time" => "%{duration}" }
        flush_interval => 10
        # This makes the timing stats pertain to only the previous 5 minutes
        # instead of since Logstash last started.
        clear_interval => 300
        add_field => {"type" => "processing"}
        add_tag => "metric"
      }
    }
  }
  # Count the number of logins via SSH from /var/log/auth.log
  if "auth_log" in [tags] and [message] =~ /sshd.*session opened/ {
    metrics {
      # This determines how often metric events will be sent to the agent, and
      # thus how often datapoints will be emitted.
      flush_interval => 10
      # The name of the meter will be used to construct the name of the metric
      # in SignalFx.  For this example, a datapoint called `logins.count` would
      # be generated.
      meter => "logins"
      add_tag => "metric"
    }
  }
}

output {
  # This can be helpful to debug
  stdout { codec => rubydebug }

  if "metric" in [tags] {
    tcp {
      port => 8900
      # The agent will connect to Logstash
      mode => "server"
      # Needs to be '0.0.0.0' if running in a container.
      host => "127.0.0.1"
    }
  }
}
```
Once Logstash is configured with the above configuration. The logstash-tcp monitor
will collect `logins.count` and `process_time.<timer_field>`. See config options
for default values.


## Configuration
#### logstash monitor
To activate this monitor in the Smart Agent, add the following to your
agent config:

```
monitors:  # All monitor config goes under this key
 - type: logstash
   ...  # Additional config
```

**For a list of monitor options that are common to all monitors, see [Common
Configuration](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/docs/monitors/../monitor-config.md#common-configuration).**


| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `host` | no | `string` | The hostname of Logstash monitoring API (**default:** `127.0.0.1`) |
| `port` | no | `integer` | The port number of Logstash monitoring API (**default:** `9600`) |
| `useHTTPS` | no | `bool` | If true, the agent will connect to the host using HTTPS instead of plain HTTP. (**default:** `false`) |
| `timeoutSeconds` | no | `integer` | The maximum amount of time to wait for API requests (**default:** `5`) |
#### logstash-tcp monitor
To activate this monitor in the Smart Agent, add the following to your
agent config:

```
monitors:  # All monitor config goes under this key
 - type: logstash-tcp
   ...  # Additional config
```

**For a list of monitor options that are common to all monitors, see [Common
Configuration](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/docs/monitors/../monitor-config.md#common-configuration).**


| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `host` | **yes** | `string` | If `mode: server`, the local IP address to listen on.  If `mode: client`, the Logstash host/ip to connect to. |
| `port` | no | `integer` | If `mode: server`, the local port to listen on.  If `mode: client`, the port of the Logstash TCP output plugin.  If port is `0`, a random listening port is assigned by the kernel. (**default:** `0`) |
| `mode` | no | `string` | Whether to act as a `server` or `client`.  The corresponding setting in the Logtash `tcp` output plugin should be set to the opposite of this. (**default:** `client`) |
| `desiredTimerFields` | no | `list of strings` |  (**default:** `[mean, max, p99, count]`) |
| `reconnectDelay` | no | `integer` | How long to wait before reconnecting if the TCP connection cannot be made or after it gets broken. (**default:** `5s`) |

### Non-default metrics (version 4.7.0+)

**The following information applies to the agent version 4.7.0+ that has
`enableBuiltInFiltering: true` set on the top level of the agent config.**

To emit metrics that are not _default_, you can add those metrics in the
generic monitor-level `extraMetrics` config option.  Metrics that are derived
from specific configuration options that do not appear in the above list of
metrics do not need to be added to `extraMetrics`.

To see a list of metrics that will be emitted you can run `agent-status
monitors` after configuring this monitor in a running agent instance.

### Legacy non-default metrics (version < 4.7.0)

**The following information only applies to agent version older than 4.7.0. If
you have a newer agent and have set `enableBuiltInFiltering: true` at the top
level of your agent config, see the section above. See upgrade instructions in
[Old-style whitelist filtering](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/docs/monitors/../legacy-filtering.md#old-style-whitelist-filtering).**

If you have a reference to the `whitelist.json` in your agent's top-level
`metricsToExclude` config option, and you want to emit metrics that are not in
that whitelist, then you need to add an item to the top-level
`metricsToInclude` config option to override that whitelist (see [Inclusion
filtering](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/docs/monitors/../legacy-filtering.md#inclusion-filtering).  Or you can just
copy the whitelist.json, modify it, and reference that in `metricsToExclude`.
