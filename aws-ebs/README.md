### INSTALLATION

To access this integration, [connect to CloudWatch](https://github.com/signalfx/integrations/tree/master/aws)[](sfx_link:aws).

By default, SignalFx will import all CloudWatch metrics that are available in your account. To retrieve metrics for a subset of available services or regions, modify the connection on the Integrations page.

### USAGE

#### Uniquely identifying EBS Volumes

SignalFx synthesizes a unique ID for each EBS volume in the dimension `AWSUniqueId`.

#### EBS metadata

For EBS, SignalFx will scan every volume ID from your AWS account and pull out properties of the volume and any tags set on the volume.

|-----------------|-----------------|-------------|
| availability-zone	| aws\_availability\_zone |	The Availability Zone in which the volume was created |
| create-time	| aws\_create\_time |	The time stamp when the volume was created |
| encrypted	| aws\_encrypted |	The encryption status of the volume |
| iops	| aws\_iops | The number of I/O operations per second (IOPS) that the volume supports |
| kms\_key\_id	| aws\_kms\_key\_id | The full ARN of the AWS customer master key used to protect the volume encryption key for the volume |
| size	| aws\_size | The size of the volume, in GiB |
| snapshot\_id	| aws\_snapshot\_id |	The snapshot from which the volume was created |
