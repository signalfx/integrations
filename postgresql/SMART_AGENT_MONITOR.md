### INSTALLATION

This integration is part of the [SignalFx Smart Agent](https://github.com/signalfx/integrations/tree/master/signalfx-agent)[](sfx_link:signalfx-agent)
as the `postgresql` monitor. You should first deploy the Smart Agent to the
same host as the service you want to monitor, and then continue with the
configuration instructions below.

## Description

**This integration primarily consists of the Smart Agent monitor `postgresql`.
Below is an overview of that monitor.**

### Smart Agent Monitor


This monitor pulls metrics from all PostgreSQL databases from a specific
Postgres server instance.  It pulls basic information that is applicable
to any database.  It gathers these metrics via SQL queries.

<!--- OVERVIEW --->
## Metrics about Queries

In order to get metrics about query execution time, you must enable the
`pg_stat_statements` extension.  This extension must be specified in the
`shared_preload_libraries` config option in the main PostgreSQL
configuration at server start up.  Then the extension must be enabled for
each database by running `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS
pg_stat_statements;` on each database.

Note that in order to get consistent and accurate query execution time
metrics, you must set the [pg_stat_statements.max config
option](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/pgstatstatements.html#AEN160631)
to larger than the number of distinct queries on the server.

Here is a [sample configuration of Postgres to enable statement tracking](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/pgstatstatements.html#AEN160631).

Tested with PostgreSQL `9.2+`.

If you want to collect additional metrics about PostgreSQL, use the [sql monitor](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/docs/monitors/./sql.md).

<!--- SETUP --->
## Example Configuration

This example uses the [Vault remote config
source](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/blob/master/docs/remote-config.md#nested-values-vault-only)
to connect to PostgreSQL using the `params` map that allows you to pull
out the username and password individually from Vault and interpolate
them into the `connectionString` config option.

```yaml
monitors:
 - type: postgresql
   connectionString: 'sslmode=disable user={{.username}} password={{.password}}'
   params: &psqlParams
     username: {"#from": "vault:secret/my-database[username]"}
     password: {"#from": "vault:secret/my-database[password]"}
   discoveryRule: 'container_image =~ "postgres" && port == 5432'

 # This monitor will monitor additional queries from PostgreSQL using the
 # provided SQL queries.
 - type: sql
   dbDriver: postgres
   connectionString: 'sslmode=disable user={{.username}} password={{.password}}'
   # This is a YAML reference to avoid duplicating the above config.
   params: *psqlParams
   queries:
     - query: 'SELECT COUNT(*) as count, country, status FROM customers GROUP BY country, status;'
       metrics:
         - metricName: "customers"
           valueColumn: "count"
           dimensionColumns: ["country", "status"]
```


## Configuration

To activate this monitor in the Smart Agent, add the following to your
agent config:

```
monitors:  # All monitor config goes under this key
 - type: postgresql
   ...  # Additional config
```

**For a list of monitor options that are common to all monitors, see [Common
Configuration](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/docs/monitors/../monitor-config.md#common-configuration).**


| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `host` | no | `string` |  |
| `port` | no | `integer` |  (**default:** `0`) |
| `masterDBName` | no | `string` | The "master" database to which the agent first connects to query the list of databases available in the server.  This database should be accessible to the user specified with `connectionString` and `params` below, and that user should have permission to query `pg_database`.  If you want to filter which databases are monitored, use the `databases` option below. (**default:** `postgres`) |
| `connectionString` | no | `string` | See https://godoc.org/github.com/lib/pq#hdr-Connection_String_Parameters. |
| `params` | no | `map of strings` | Parameters to the connection string that can be templated into the connection string with the syntax `{{.key}}`. |
| `databases` | no | `list of strings` | List of databases to send database-specific metrics about.  If omitted, metrics about all databases will be sent.  This is an [overridable set](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/integrations/agent/filtering.html#overridable-filters). (**default:** `[*]`) |
| `databasePollIntervalSeconds` | no | `integer` | How frequently to poll for new/deleted databases in the DB server. Defaults to the same as `intervalSeconds` if not set. (**default:** `0`) |
| `topQueryLimit` | no | `integer` | The number of top queries to consider when publishing query-related metrics (**default:** `10`) |


## Metrics

Metrics that are categorized as
[container/host](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/admin-guide/usage.html#about-custom-bundled-and-high-resolution-metrics)
(*default*) are ***in bold and italics*** in the list below.

These are the metrics available for this integration.

 - ***`postgres_block_hit_ratio`*** (*gauge*)<br>    The proportion (between 0 and 1, inclusive) of block reads that used the cache and did not have to go to the disk.  Is sent for `table`, `index`, and the `database` as a whole.
 - ***`postgres_database_size`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Size in bytes of the database on disk
 - ***`postgres_deadlocks`*** (*cumulative*)<br>    Total number of deadlocks detected by the system
 - ***`postgres_index_scans`*** (*cumulative*)<br>    Total number of index scans on the `table`.
 - ***`postgres_live_rows`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Number of rows live (not deleted) in the `table`.
 - ***`postgres_query_count`*** (*cumulative*)<br>    Total number of queries executed on the `database`, broken down by `user`.  Note that the accuracy of this metric depends on the PostgreSQL [pg_stat_statements.max config option](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/pgstatstatements.html#AEN160631) being large enough to hold all queries.

 - ***`postgres_query_time`*** (*cumulative*)<br>    Total time taken to execute queries on the `database`, broken down by `user`.
 - ***`postgres_rows_deleted`*** (*cumulative*)<br>    Number of rows deleted from the `table`.
 - ***`postgres_rows_inserted`*** (*cumulative*)<br>    Number of rows inserted into the `table`.
 - ***`postgres_rows_updated`*** (*cumulative*)<br>    Number of rows updated in the `table`.
 - ***`postgres_sequential_scans`*** (*cumulative*)<br>    Total number of sequential scans on the `table`.
 - ***`postgres_sessions`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Number of sessions currently on the server instance.  The `state` dimension will specify which which type of session (see `state` row of [pg_stat_activity](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/monitoring-stats.html#PG-STAT-ACTIVITY-VIEW)).

 - ***`postgres_table_size`*** (*gauge*)<br>    The size in bytes of the `table` on disk.

#### Group queries
All of the following metrics are part of the `queries` metric group. All of
the non-default metrics below can be turned on by adding `queries` to the
monitor config option `extraGroups`:
 - `postgres_queries_average_time` (*cumulative*)<br>    Top N queries based on the average execution time broken down by `database`
 - `postgres_queries_calls` (*cumulative*)<br>    Top N most frequently executed queries broken down by `database`
 - `postgres_queries_total_time` (*cumulative*)<br>    Top N queries based on the total execution time broken down by `database`

### Non-default metrics (version 4.7.0+)

**The following information applies to the agent version 4.7.0+ that has
`enableBuiltInFiltering: true` set on the top level of the agent config.**

To emit metrics that are not _default_, you can add those metrics in the
generic monitor-level `extraMetrics` config option.  Metrics that are derived
from specific configuration options that do not appear in the above list of
metrics do not need to be added to `extraMetrics`.

To see a list of metrics that will be emitted you can run `agent-status
monitors` after configuring this monitor in a running agent instance.

### Legacy non-default metrics (version < 4.7.0)

**The following information only applies to agent version older than 4.7.0. If
you have a newer agent and have set `enableBuiltInFiltering: true` at the top
level of your agent config, see the section above. See upgrade instructions in
[Old-style whitelist filtering](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/docs/monitors/../legacy-filtering.md#old-style-whitelist-filtering).**

If you have a reference to the `whitelist.json` in your agent's top-level
`metricsToExclude` config option, and you want to emit metrics that are not in
that whitelist, then you need to add an item to the top-level
`metricsToInclude` config option to override that whitelist (see [Inclusion
filtering](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/docs/monitors/../legacy-filtering.md#inclusion-filtering).  Or you can just
copy the whitelist.json, modify it, and reference that in `metricsToExclude`.

## Dimensions

The following dimensions may occur on metrics emitted by the monitors. Some
dimensions may be specific to certain metrics.
